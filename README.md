# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the detection of fake news using machine learning algorithms. Four different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes) were evaluated across four distinct feature sets: Word Count, N-Gram Count, TF-IDF, and Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to determine the most effective feature set and classifier for fake news detection.

# Datasets
The datasets used in this project are:

I have used the ISOT Fake News , Real News Dataset for this project there are two csv files for the dataset
1) True.csv
2) Fake.csv

Both datasets contain news snippets labeled as "Fake News" or "Not A Fake News".

# Feature Extraction
Four different feature extraction methods were used:

1) Word Count
2) N-Gram Count
3) TF-IDF
4) Sentiment Analysis
5) Model Training and Evaluation

Four classifiers were used to train the models and evaluate their performance:

1) Logistic Regression (LR)
2) Decision Tree (DT)
3) Random Forest (RF)
4) Naive Bayes (NB)
5) Each classifier was evaluated using each feature set to determine the accuracy of fake news detection.

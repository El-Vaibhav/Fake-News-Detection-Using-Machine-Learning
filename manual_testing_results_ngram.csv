cox s bazar  bangladesh  reuters    an estimated   rohingya have sought refuge in bangladesh over the past two weeks  the u n  refugee agency said on friday  announcing a dramatic jump in numbers fleeing violence in neighboring myanmar s rakhine state  a rights group said satellite images showed about  buildings had been burned down in a myanmar border town largely inhabited by rohingya  as part of what the muslim minority refugees say is a concerted effort to expel them  the u n  high commissioner for refugees said the estimated number of rohingya who fled to bangladesh since violence erupted in myanmar on aug   had risen from   on thursday  after  aid workers found big groups in border areas   we have identified more people in different areas that we were not aware of   said vivian tan  a spokeswoman for unhcr  while adding that there could be some double counting   the numbers are so alarming   it really means that we have to step up our response and that the situation in myanmar has to be addressed urgently   the latest flight of rohingya began two weeks ago after rohingya insurgents attacked security force posts in myanmar s rakhine state  that triggered an army counteroffensive in which at least  people died   the united states  a principle backer of aung san suu kyi s civilian government that came to power in myanmar last year  said there had been shortcomings on the part of myanmar security forces and the government in dealing with the situation  patrick murphy  u s  deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia  said washington was calling in talks with myanmar s military and civilian leaders for urgent restoration of access to rakhine state for humanitarian assistance and journalists  he said the security forces must respond responsibly to the attacks that began the crisis  telling reporters   they have a responsibility to carry out those activities in accordance with rule of law and international human rights  rights groups briefed u n  security council diplomats on the myanmar violence on friday  russia and china did not send any diplomats  according to people at the meeting  myanmar has said it is was counting on china and russia to protect it from any security council censure   u n  secretary general antonio guterres spoke with suu kyi by phone on wednesday and reiterated his concerns about the situation in rakhine state  u n  spokesman stephane dujarric told reuters  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said the united states was  deeply troubled by continued reports of attacks against innocent civilians and will continue to urge  myanmar  security forces to respect those civilians as it conducts security operations   washington was also calling on myanmar to ensure that aid reached those in need as quickly as possible   and that it is delivered in a manner that protects their rights and dignity   she said in a statement  the wave of refugees  many sick or wounded  has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in myanmar  many have no shelter  and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water  sanitation and food   we need to prepare for many more to come  i am afraid   said shinni kubo  bangladesh country manager for unhcr   we need huge financial resources  this is unprecedented  this is dramatic  it will continue for weeks and weeks   while most refugees are coming on foot  many are braving the sea  at least  boats carrying rohingya arrived in bangladesh s cox s bazar district on wednesday  the international organisation for migration  iom  said  buddhist majority myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for the attacks on the security forces  burning homes and civilian deaths   it says about   non muslims have been displaced  the   million rohingya living in myanmar have long complained of persecution  they are denied citizenship and regarded as illegal migrants from bangladesh  there is very limited access to the north of rakhine state and few if any independent witnesses  raising fears that a humanitarian crisis could be unfolding among rohingya still there   what we know is what people are saying as they come across  and what they re saying now  given this been going on since aug    is they are in an absolutely desperate state   said iom s leonard doyle   they say  they are  living out in  the  open  without protection from the tropical sun with their children  without enough food to eat    bangladesh has proposed  safe zones  run by aid groups for rohingya in myanmar  but it would seem the plan is unlikely to be accepted there  human rights watch said satellite images taken last saturday showed hundreds of burned buildings in maungdaw  a district capital in rakhine state  in areas primarily inhabited by rohingya   if safety cannot even be found in area capitals  then no place may be safe   said phil robertson  the group s deputy asia director  a myanmar reporter in the north of the state said he had reports from residents of an area called rathedaung that six villages there had been torched and that there had also been shooting in the area  it was not clear who was responsible  critics have accused suu kyi of not speaking out for the rohingya and some have called for the nobel peace prize she won in  as a champion of democracy to be revoked  the united states has been careful to avoid direct criticism of suu kyi  and murphy said washington was looking to help myanmar s transition to democracy succeed   he noted that most authority in rakhine state lay with the military  which wielded direct power in myanmar for decades before suu kyi s election win  murphy called for implementation of recommendations of a commission led by former u n  chief kofi annan set up to find solutions for the ethnically and religiously divided rakhine   the fact that over a million people inside the country have been devoid of basic rights for generations has been a long standing issue   murphy said   it needs to be addressed   protests against the treatment of the rohingya were held in several countries  including muslim majority bangladesh   indonesia and malaysia  others were held outside myanmar s embassies in tokyo and manila  malaysian prime minister najib razak said he was considering raising the issue in talks with u s  president donald trump next week  malaysia s coastguard said it was willing to offer rohingya  temporary shelter  although it is unlikely refugees would travel hundreds of kilometres south by sea during the monsoon season  which lasts until late november  thailand has also said it is preparing to receive people fleeing myanmar  while singapore said it was ready to help the humanitarian effort  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

united nations  reuters    the united states wants the united nations security council to vote next monday to impose  the strongest possible  sanctions on north korea over its sixth and largest nuclear test  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said on monday   north korea said it tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long range missile on sunday  prompting global condemnation and a u s  warning of a  massive  military response if it or its allies were threatened  china s u n  ambassador liu jieyi pushed north korea on monday  to stop taking actions that are wrong  deteriorating the situation and not in line with its own interests and truly return to the track of solving the issue through dialogue    haley said the  member council would negotiate a draft resolution this week  she described north korean leader kim jong un as  begging for war  and that while the united states doesn t want conflict   our country s patience is not unlimited    enough is enough   haley told the council   only the strongest sanctions will enable us to resolve this problem through diplomacy   since   the security council has unanimously adopted eight resolutions ratcheting up sanctions on north korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs  haley said the council s incremental approach to sanctions had not worked  the council last month imposed new sanctions over north korea s two long range missile launches in july   the resolution aimed to slash by a third pyongyang s   billion annual export revenue by banning exports of coal  iron  lead and seafood  diplomats have said the council could now consider banning pyongyang s textile exports and the country s national airline  stop supplies of oil to the government and military  prevent north koreans from working abroad as well as add top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban    a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the united states  britain  france  russia or china to pass  typically  china and russia only view a test of a long range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for u n  sanctions  china has not publicly said it will back new sanctions  russian u n  ambassador vassily nebenzia said he would consider a u s  draft resolution but questioned whether further sanctions would make a difference    whatever measures we are planning now  i m not sure that they will influence the other side to abandon what they have been doing  this is not the way to get parties at the table     to seek for a political solution   he told reporters  he told the council there was an urgent need to  maintain a cool head  and avoid escalating tensions  and called for a return to dialogue  including  by leveraging mediation efforts  of u n  secretary general antonio guterres  both russia and china pushed their proposal to kick start talks with a joint suspension of north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the military exercises by the united states and south korea  liu said he hoped it would be seriously considered by the parties    the idea that some have suggested of a so called freeze for freeze is insulting   haley told the council   when a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon and an icbm  intercontinental ballistic missile  pointed at you  you do not take steps to lower your guard  no one would do that  we certainly won t   through sanctions  the security council has tried to choke off funding and support for north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs  though some western states have expressed doubt about russia and china s commitment to implement them  haley said in july that cutting off oil supplies to the north korean government and military was an option   china supplies most of north korea s crude  according to south korean data  beijing supplies roughly   tonnes of crude oil annually  it also exports   tonnes of oil products  according to u n  data  the u n  resolution adopted last month capped the number of north koreans working abroad at the current level  diplomats said a new resolution could impose a complete ban  some diplomats estimate that between   and   north koreans work abroad  a u n  human rights investigator said in  that north korea was forcing more than   people to work abroad  mainly in russia and china  earning between    billion and    billion a year  the council could ban textiles  which were north korea s second biggest export after coal and other minerals in   totaling   million  according to data from the korea trade investment promotion agency  kotra   nearly  percent of the textile exports went to china  the military controlled airline  air koryo  could be banned  it flies to beijing and a few other cities in china  including dandong  the main transit point for trade between the two countries  it also flies to vladivostok in russia  but flights to bangkok  kuala lumpur and kuwait have ended  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake

hazima  syria  reuters    the few bullet marked schools islamic state did not flatten or booby trap around its former syrian stronghold of raqqa are buzzing for the first time in years with the sound of children learning  in the village of hazima  north of raqqa  teachers gave ad hoc alphabet lessons to crammed classrooms on a recent summer s day before the start of term    right now  the most important thing is to get children into class   said teacher ahmed al ahmed  standing next to a hole in the school stairwell left by a mine blast that wounded a colleague  the ultra hardline islamic state closed this school and  many others in northern syria after it seized control of the region in   three years into the country s civil war  instead it taught children extremist thought in mosques  but now that the group has been ousted from most territory it held in and around raqqa by a u s  backed military alliance  the syrian democratic forces  sdf   a growing debate over education points to the ethnic tensions expected to follow  what is taught in areas under the control of the sdf  which includes arab militias but is dominated by the kurdish ypg  is one of many questions over how predominantly arab parts of northern syria will be run as they come into the kurdish fold  schools around raqqa will this year teach a new curriculum that is based on old textbooks but erases the baathist ideology of president bashar al assad  a decision agreed on by arab and kurdish teachers alike  but an official in the sdf has floated the immediate introduction of kurdish lessons in raqqa schools  an idea that makes local officials bristle  in contrast with other areas under sdf control that have for years taught kurdish  there are no plans yet to teach the language in mostly arab raqqa   officials say it would need broad consensus  hinting at concerns that its introduction too quickly would cause unrest   we wouldn t object to kurdish teaching  but if it s imposed on schools then there will be problems   ahmed said  the ypg has held areas of northeast syria since early in the six year old war which are now under a self run administration opposed by assad  who holds the main population centers in the west and is also advancing against islamic state  and turkey  a ypg foe which borders syria  raqqa is likely to join the administration  officials say  all ethnic groups are represented in the local bodies that run majority arab regions captured by the sdf as it ousted is fighters but critics say kurds dominate decision making  reuters interviews with sdf officials and local authorities suggest resentment over kurdish power is brewing over education plans  a senior sdf adviser and coordinator with the u s  coalition said he believed kurdish would be taught to kurdish pupils around raqqa this year  following the model for other schools in sdf territory   no one has opposed this     every  ethnic  group has the right to study in its own language   amed sido said via the internet  officials in the raqqa civil council  the newly formed local governing body  were taken aback   no  that won t happen without consultations with us and agreement in the council   ammar hussein  an education committee official  said at its office in the town of ain issa   for now it s in arabic  with english and french lessons   echoing several council members  he said kurdish would be taught only if families requested it  there were enough qualified teachers and the arab kurdish council approved it   if the people here agree     there won t be any objection   said ali shanna  another education committee official   but the kurd knows the kurdish language  why does he need to learn it    a former kurdish teacher privately derided shanna s comments   i hate that attitude  it s ignorance  it s the same thinking as daesh  islamic state    said the teacher  who had been jailed under assad for writing a kurdish language journal  the sensitivity over language has already caused unrest in hasaka to the northeast  an area controlled for years by the ypg where a new curriculum is taught in arabic and kurdish  both now official languages  in demonstrations reported by a monitoring group  protesters called for arab children not to have to learn kurdish  mostafa bali  an sdf official  said there was no intention to force kurdish on arabs  or to suppress arabic   we don t support racism over language  but there are many kurds who would like to see arabic teaching banned in kurdish areas as revenge for the baath  teaching    he said  the baathist curriculum championed arab nationalism over ethnic identity  kurdish pupils were punished for speaking their mother tongue in school playgrounds  now  even in some arab majority towns  kurds are taught kurdish  officials in raqqa are determined to do things their way  regardless of what they say are potential military threats from assad or neighboring turkey   we won t let turkey or anyone else interfere in our internal affairs  we decide what we ll teach or not teach   leila mostafa  the kurdish co president of the raqqa civil council said  at hazima school  teachers worry about both the legacy left by islamic state and assad  and future political upheaval   one kid turned up singing islamic state chants   teacher ahmed saoud said   the teachers say  racist  baathist modules help fuel syria s conflict and are anxious to begin the new curriculum   it s urgent we start teaching  the next phase will be difficult   there ll be a reckoning between factions   ahmed al ahmed said

shot down a syrian fighter aircraft  the first u s  downing of a manned jet since   and also shot down two iranian made drones that threatened u s  led coalition forces    all the while  u s  and

parallel campaigns on syria s shrinking battlefields  there is also a telephone hotline linking the former cold war foes  air operations centers  u s  officials told reuters that there now are about  to  calls a day on the hotline  helping keep u s  and russian warplanes apart as they support different fighters on the ground  that is no small task  given the complexities of syria s civil war

interface for conversations with russian commanders    while the conversations are not easy  contacts between the two sides have remained resilient  senior u s  commanders said   the reality is we ve worked through some very hard problems and  in general  we have found a way to maintain the deconfliction line  that separates u s  and russian areas of operation  and found a way to continue our mission   lieutenant general jeffrey harrigian  the top u s  air force commander in the middle east  said in an interview   as both sides scramble to capture what is left of islamic state s caliphate  the risk of accidental contacts is growing   we have to negotiate  and sometimes the phone calls are tense  because for us  this is about protecting ourselves  our coalition partners and destroying the enemy   harrigian said  without commenting on the volume of calls  the risks of miscalculation came into full view in june  when the united states shot down a syrian su  jet that was preparing to fire on u s  backed forces on the ground   u s  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said  those were not the only aircraft in the area  as the incident unfolded  two russian fighter jets looked on from above and a american f  stealth aircraft kept watch from an even higher altitude  they told reuters  after the incident  moscow publicly warned it would consider any planes flying west

fighters on the ground as fighting pushes toward islamic state s last major syrian stronghold  the deir al zor region  the line runs in an irregular arc from a point southwest of tabqa east to a point on the euphrates river and then down along the euphrates river in the direction of deir al zor  they said  u s  defense secretary jim mattis  during a visit to jordan this week  said the line was important as u s   and russian backed forces come in closer proximity of each other   we do not do that  communication  with the  syrian  regime  it is with the russians  is who we re dealing with

houston  reuters    monster hurricane irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern caribbean  worsening a fuel supply crunch in latin america which is struggling to meet demand since hurricane harvey disrupted shipments from the u s  gulf coast last month  latin america had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of harvey  which caused massive flooding in texas and louisiana  shutting down ports  refineries and production platforms  irma  which is being followed by two hurricanes in the atlantic and gulf of mexico  was affecting caribbean refineries  terminals and storage facilities  the u s  national hurricane center said irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the atlantic ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the atlantic basin in  years  the caribbean has the capacity to store more than  million barrels  which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude  and also as supply for south american nations including brazil  venezuela and colombia   several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their u s  fuel inventories to the caribbean ahead of harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to latin america  traders from two companies told reuters   those barrels are now locked in terminals in st  eustatius  puerto rico  the bahamas and the u s  virgin islands  as irma  a category  storm with winds of  mph   kph   was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west northwest    irma is arriving at a bad moment  not all oil storage facilities in the caribbean have closed  but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm  it will get worse before getting any better   said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in st  croix  buckeye partners lp  bpl n   the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the caribbean with   million barrels of capacity  shut its puerto rico terminal on wednesday  it also plans to close borco  its largest terminal in the bahamas that can store up to   million barrels  by the end of the day on thursday  a source familiar with terminal operations said  also in the bahamas  statoil s  stl ol  south riding point terminal was open on thursday  the company said  but traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on thursday   nustar energy lp  ns n   which on tuesday closed its  million barrel statia terminal on the small island of st  eustatius  said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane  so no restart date has been set  firms using tanks in closed terminals in st  eustatius  st  croix  bahamas and puerto rico include traders vitol  glencore  glen l   novum energy and freepoint commodities  and oil firms pdvsa from venezuela  china s sinopec   ss   russia s rosneft  rosn mm  and lukoil  lkoh mm   u s  chevron corp  cvx n  and royal dutch shell plc  rdsa l   according to the sources and reuters vessel data  as traders worry about irma s impact on inventories  others see longer term potential consequences from this or other storms  as both jose  now in the atlantic ocean  and katia  off mexico s coast  continued moving on thursday after strengthening to hurricanes   if a hurricane with irma s intensity strikes a terminal tank farm  the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks  which are typically not designed to withstand those forces   said ernie barsamian  chief executive officer of the tank tiger  a terminal storage clearinghouse  mexican state run oil company pemex said on thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far  but it keeps monitoring katia s path to decide if further action was needed  fuel importers such as mexico and brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the u s  east coast  europe and the caribbean  according to traders  regulators and oil firms  but those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels  the only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as brazil  which bought diesel in excess  or venezuela  which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country s fiscal problems  at least three fuel cargoes have been diverted from venezuela since last week  according to reuters data  all of them have changed their destinations to panama  likely to pass the canal before discharging in south america    companies from uruguay  ecuador  peru and costa rica are seeking spot cargoes of diesel  gasoline  aviation gasoline  asphalt and components on the open market  but few providers are willing to participate  traders said   i cannot use my inventories in the caribbean at this moment to supply third parties   one trader said  dominican republic refining firm refidomsa  which declared force majeure last week on deliveries  has been rationing fuel from its   barrel per day haina refinery  giving it enough inventory for  days   most caribbean refineries are dependent on u s  light oil since large regional crude producers such as mexico and venezuela have cut exports to some neighbors  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

official who helps coordinate the european union s north korea policy  so for now  despite calls from russia  china  and others  there is no push from the united states or north korea for direct talks  despite an escalating crisis that threatens millions of lives after north korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last weekend   the trump administration says the united nations needs to tighten economic sanctions to pressure north korea to change its behavior and start talking  a draft sanctions resolution was circulated to the united nations security council on wednesday  trump s tactics  one senior administration official said on the condition of anonymity  mirror those in many of his business deals  simultaneously playing good cop and bad cop  not appearing too interested in making a deal but keeping lines of communication open  trump said on wednesday after a call with chinese leader xi jinping that military action against north korea was not a first choice   but we will see what happens   nikki haley  the u s  ambassador to the united nations  said on sunday that kim was  begging for war   but added   the time has come for us to exhaust all of our diplomatic means before it s too late   the united states wants the security council to impose an oil embargo on north korea  ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of north korean laborers abroad and subject leader kim jong un to an asset freeze and travel ban  according to a draft resolution seen by reuters on wednesday  it was not immediately clear if the draft had the support of north korean ally china  which along with russia  while denouncing the latest test  has said that resolving the nuclear crisis is impossible with sanctions and pressure alone   a decade of sanctions has not slowed north korea s nuclear weapons program  and now that it is closer to its goal  diplomats and analysts say it is unlikely to back down   the u s  policy of strategic patience on north korea has assumed that time is on their side   that economic sanctions will eventually lead to the collapse of kim jong un s regime and its economy  and it will come to the negotiating table  no longer able to withstand the economic pain   said moon chung in  a special adviser to south korea s president on foreign affairs and national security   however  such an assumption has now proven wrong  north korea s economy has not only adapted quickly to tightening sanctions  but the country has also succeeded in advancing its nuclear weapons programs despite more than a decade of economic hardship   zhao tong  a beijing based north korea expert at the carnegie tsinghua center  said pyongyang may hope washington ultimately will recognize it has developed a credible nuclear capability  abandon its long standing precondition for talks   that north korea accept that they be aimed at its nuclear disarmament   and instead seek the freezing its nuclear program   from the north korean perspective  their strategy is working   he said   most experts say it no longer is realistic to think north korea will trade away its nuclear arsenal in exchange for sanctions relief  economic support  or a peace treaty with the united states ending the formal state of war that has existed since the   korean war  robert einhorn  a former senior u s  non proliferation specialist now at the brookings institution think tank in washington  said north korea has learned from the u s  invasion of iraq and the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi s decision to stop developing weapons of mass destruction  that you can t give up critical assets that you need for your own survival   china has put forth a  freeze for freeze  proposal that would suspend large scale u s  military exercises with south korea in return for a suspension of north korean nuclear and missile tests  washington continues to reject that idea  but the longer diplomacy is delayed  the greater the chances that north korea can master the ability to hit the u s  mainland with nuclear tipped missiles  and then enter talks from a position of strength  south korea is keeping open the option of dialogue with north korea  and hopes washington and seoul can develop a diplomatic  roadmap   cho hyun  south korea s second vice foreign minister  said at a seminar in washington on tuesday   it may sound unrealistic today  but we cannot abandon it

on board a u s  military aircraft  reuters    the u s  air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following president donald trump s decision to forge ahead with the  year old war  its top general told reuters on tuesday  air force chief of staff general david goldfein said  however  he was still examining the matter  as the u s  military s top brass had only begun the process of translating trump s war strategy into action  asked whether the air force would dedicate more assets to afghanistan  where the united states has been engaged in its longest military conflict  goldfein said only   possibly     it s actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus ups and reductions   he said in a joint interview with air force secretary heather wilson  still  he acknowledged that the air force was  absolutely  examining the possibility of increasing air power  including to support u s  ground forces  following trump s promise of a stepped up campaign against taliban insurgents  who have gained ground against u s  backed afghan government forces   goldfein said the same about providing training to afghan pilots  wilson  who assumed the air force s top civilian job three months ago  noted the afghan military had made strides thanks to u s  training and equipment  but added   i think there is a long way to go there  very honestly    in a speech on monday night  trump appeared to answer a call from the top u s  commander on the ground for thousands of more troops to break a stalemate with taliban insurgents  on top of the roughly   now deployed in afghanistan  trump said the united states would not disclose troop numbers  but one u s  official told reuters they could start moving quickly  u s  defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he would set troop levels following the review by military chiefs  during the administration of trump s predecessor  barack obama  u s  military officials privately expressed frustration about their inability to strike at many taliban targets   including training camps    unless they could show a direct threat to u s  forces or major impact on the afghan state  wilson said trump appeared to be giving greater flexibility to strike insurgents      obviously the joint chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals  but i think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night  and we re going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks   wilson said   goldfein said   i thought that came out very loud and clear in the speech that that s his priority   wilson and goldfein spoke to reuters while flying back to the united states after a nine day trip that included a visit to afghanistan  where the u s  military has ramped up its firepower against islamic state in recent months even as it helps afghan forces battle the taliban    particularly for the u s  air force  the size of the american commitment to afghanistan far outweighs the number of airmen deployed there  a network of u s  installations throughout the middle east supports the afghan campaign  including in qatar and the united arab emirates   still  any substantial increase in u s  targeting of the taliban and islamic state militants would likely require dedicating more u s  military assets to build intelligence  strike insurgent targets and provide support to u s  forces in the field  although the u s  military is stretched  a string of u s  coalition backed victories by iraqi forces against islamic state might free up some firepower and intelligence assets for afghanistan  experts say  air force spokesman brigadier general edward thomas declined to speculate on operational planning  but he noted that u s  air power from the region could be deployed  if needed  including fighter aircraft  bombers and spy planes      with the detailed planning that will follow the president s announcement  the air force will be ready to swing any additional airmen and aircraft to the fight as required    thomas said   trump ran for the presidency calling for a swift u s  withdrawal from afghanistan  which the united states invaded in october   and he acknowledged on monday that he was going against his instincts in approving the new campaign plan sought by his military advisers  wilson said trump s remarks represented a  strategic correction  in the war effort along with a significant shift in policy on pakistan  in his speech  trump delivered a sharp rebuke to islamabad for allowing taliban insurgents a safe haven from which launch attacks in afghanistan  and said it had  much to lose  unless it changed course  pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting u s  and afghan government forces in afghanistan  reuters has reported that the united states has been considering a range of actions  including withholding aid to pakistan and  perhaps  ramping up drone strikes  successive u s  administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan  and the u s  military has been dependent in the past on overflight or land routes through pakistan to resupply its forces in landlocked afghanistan    wilson did not rule out a future u s  military role against militants in pakistan should islamabad fail to act  but she said trump s focus appeared to be on diplomatic efforts for now    my assumption is that there will be some intense diplomatic pressure   she said  goldfein said he was not aware of any changes to u s  pakistani military ties  but acknowledged the military would take its cues from the state department   i can tell you that i have a fairly robust dialogue with the pakistani air chief  i ve hosted him  he s hosted me   goldfein said   but that dialogue is always supportive of the diplomatic dialogue    ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

court after it voided last month s presidential results  last friday s historic decision  the first of its kind in africa  was welcomed by many as a rare sign of independence from kenya s judiciary  it means voters will again have to choose between president uhuru kenyatta    and veteran opposition leader raila odinga     but others feared that after a relatively peaceful election campaign  it could open the door to political instability  reviving memories of the violence that followed a disputed  election when more than   people died  despite being prone to occasional unrest  kenya is viewed by the united states and other allies as an anchor of stability in the region  east africa s richest country per capita and main trade route between the coast and the interior  it has avoided

 said francis ole kaparo  the chair of the national cohesion and integration commission  the government body in charge of preventing hate speech   as of yesterday morning we were investigating  cases of hate mongering in the social media  i believe the number has probably doubled as we are sitting here   he told a press conference  they had less than a third of that number for the whole ten week

crowd in a speech in the kikuyu language peppered with coarse words in kiambu county on the outskirts of the capital    we went and gave birth to a baby  the election   that baby did not die during pregnancy or during delivery  the baby had started to suckle  raila then came and stuck his finger in the baby s arse and killed it   he said during the speech  which was filmed and posted on youtube   later  he posted on his facebook page   manhunt is on tonight for the   people who did not vote and the   that voted for that other demon   the biggest worry in kenya is violence taking on an ethnic dimension  as in   president kenyatta is from the largest of kenya s  tribes  the kikuyu  while many of odinga s supporters believe his luo ethnic group has been locked out of power  police denied reports  which were posted online and repeated by opposition politicians  that following kuria s speech buses had been stopped in the area and passengers questioned about their ethnicity  reuters was unable to verify the accuracy of those reports  raphael tuju  the secretary general of the ruling jubilee party  denounced kuria s speech to a local news channel hours after it was reported    that is completely out of order and i would not accept that kind of language  i will take it up with him because it is unacceptable   he said  tuju did not return calls from reuters seeking comment on what disciplinary action kuria might face   manoah esipisu  a presidential spokesman  said  state house does not comment on comments by people like moses kuria    kuria s speech came days after kenyatta

poll re run because it said there were  irregularities  by the election board  in a speech immediately after the ruling  kenyatta said he disagreed with the ruling but would accept it  but in a public rally later he referred to the judges as  wakora   a kiswahili term for a cheat  the next day  kenyatta promised to  fix  the judiciary   esipisu  the spokesman  said the president used the term wakora to criticize a judgment he views as subverting democracy   anything that doesn t express the will of the people is wakora   esipisu said   at another rally  kenyatta told a crowd that odinga was a  witchdoctor  because he was insisting on being consulted on the date of new elections   odinga told reuters in an interview that the statements were unpresidential    when the anger settles  we should have a sober campaign without insults   he said in an interview   these campaigns will be fought on the basis of serious issues  not who can shout loudest  who can insult more than the other

members of the security forces  the government said  prompting it to evacuate staff and villagers from some areas  the attacks marked a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since last october  when a similar offensive prompted a major military sweep beset by allegations of serious human rights abuses  the treatment of approximately   million muslim rohingya in mainly buddhist myanmar has emerged as the biggest challenge for national leader aung san suu kyi  who late on friday condemned the morning raids   in which insurgents wielding guns  sticks and homemade bombs assaulted  police stations and an army base  the nobel peace prize laureate has been accused by some western critics of not speaking out for the long persecuted muslim minority  and of defending the army s counteroffensive after the october attacks  some   rohingya arrived at the naf river separating myanmar and bangladesh on saturday  manzurul hassan khan  a bangladeshi border guard commander  told reuters   about  rohingya  mostly women and children  spent the last night in a marshy area waiting to cross over   said khan   we protected them the whole night  today they went back   reuters reporters saw hundreds of rohingya crossing into bangladesh near the border village of gumdhum as gun shots could be heard from the myanmar side  they could be seen squatting in a marshy area  hiding in the bushes from border guards   we managed to escape the shooting in myanmar and tried to enter bangladesh  we waited all night after we were pushed backed by bangladesh border guards last night  this morning  we managed to enter somehow   said hamid hossain    who crossed into bangladesh on saturday with a group of three families  a  year old man whose relatives said he had been shot by myanmar security forces on friday died as he was carried to bangladesh for treatment  he was buried near a refugee camp close to the border on saturday  according to camp resident mohammed shafi  who said he witnessed the burial  bangladesh s foreign ministry on saturday said it was concerned that thousands of  unarmed myanmar nationals  had assembled near the border to enter the country   rohingya have been fleeing myanmar to bangladesh since the early  and there are now around   in the country  where they are a source of tension between the two nations who both regard them as the other country s citizens   in myanmar  the government said there had been several large clashes involving hundreds of rohingya across northwestern rakhine on saturday  the fiercest fighting took place on the outskirts of the major town of maungdaw  near the alodaw pyae buddhist monastery  maungdaw resident nay myo lin    told reuters by telephone that security forces opened fire on scores of what appeared to be muslim men with guns near the monastery   police shot at them to break up the group and then the men shot back in the direction of the entrance gate of the city   said nay myo lin   as the fighting went on throughout the day  i was stuck in the monastery and didn t dare to go out  when the sound of gunshots stopped  i ran to my house   he said  fearful rakhine buddhist residents in maungdaw town gathered in homes while men stood guard by the windows  said ohmar lin  a female resident of the town   we don t go out of the house  but i am ready to fight   we are prepared with

government officials had assured the u n   about their readiness to provide troops to secure our compounds if it becomes necessary   the government said in a statement that   extremist bengali terrorists are attacking using man made mines     swords  sticks  guns  they also killed islamic religious people of their own faith who were village administrators   the term  bengali  is seen as derogatory by many rohingya as it implies they are illegal immigrants from bangladesh  although many can trace family in myanmar for generations  the myanmar army operation last year was heavily criticised internationally amid reports of civilian killings  rape and arson that a united nations investigation said probably constituted crimes against humanity  suu kyi is blocking the u n  mandated probe into the allegations  aid workers and monitors worry that the latest attacks  across a wider area than october s violence  will spark an even more aggressive army response and trigger communal clashes between muslims and buddhist ethnic rakhines  nearly  people were killed and around   displaced in communal violence in the state in   in a statement late on friday  suu kyi  strongly condemned   brutal attacks by terrorists on security forces in rakhine state    i would like to commend the members of the police and security forces who have acted with great courage in the face of many challenges   she added  the government said it had evacuated officials  teachers and hundreds of villagers to army bases and main police stations   some will be evacuated by helicopters and some will be taken out by the security forces   a military source based in rakhine told reuters  the arakan rohingya salvation army  arsa  which instigated the october attacks claimed responsibility for

will not be his  first choice   his comment appeared to be in line with classified briefings to congress in which trump s top national security aides   defense secretary jim mattis  secretary of state rex tillerson and dan coats  the director of national intelligence   stressed the search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis  lawmakers said  a senior administration official  meanwhile  said that the white house has set aside for now consideration of exiting a free trade pact with south korea  a move being contemplated by trump that could have complicated relations with seoul  in a flurry of phone calls with world leaders days after north korea s sixth and most powerful nuclear test  trump and chinese president xi jinping committed to  take further action with the goal of achieving the denuclearization of the korean peninsula   the white house said   president xi would like to do something  we ll see whether or not he can do it  but we will not be putting up with what s happening in north korea   trump told reporters  though he offered no specifics   i believe that president xi agrees with me  percent   he added  asked whether he was considering a military response to north korea  trump said   certainly  that s not our first choice  but we will see what happens   xi  who has been under pressure from trump to do more to help curb north korea s nuclear and missile programs  told the u s  president during their  minute call that the north korean issue must be resolved through  dialogue and consultation   the focus on negotiations by china  north korea s main trading partner  contrasted with trump s assertions over the last few days that now was not the time for talks with north korea while pressing instead for increased international pressure on pyongyang  the united states and south korea have asked the united nations to consider tough new sanctions on north korea after its nuclear test on sunday that pyongyang said was an advanced hydrogen bomb  late on wednesday  u s  treasury secretary steve mnuchin indicated that if the u n  security council fails to approve sufficiently strong measures  trump could authorize him to impose sanctions on any country or entity that trades with north korea   we believe that we need to economically cut off north korea   mnuchin told reporters aboard air force one as it flew back from north dakota  where trump gave a speech on tax reform   i have an executive order prepared  it s ready to go to the president  it will authorize me to       put sanctions on anybody that does trade with north korea   mnuchin said that trump would consider the order  at the appropriate time once he gives the u n  time to act   he provided no further details  including whether trump would consider slapping sanctions on china  north korea s largest trade partner  russian president vladimir putin insisted on wednesday that resolving the north korean nuclear crisis was impossible with sanctions and pressure alone  putin met south korea s moon jae in on the sidelines of an economic summit in the eastern russian city of vladivostok amid mounting international concern that their neighbor plans more weapons tests  including possibly a long range missile launch before a weekend anniversary  putin echoed other world leaders in denouncing north korea s latest nuclear bomb test on sunday  saying russia did not recognize its nuclear status   pyongyang s missile and nuclear program is a crude violation of u n  security council resolutions  undermines the non proliferation regime and creates a threat to the security of northeastern asia   putin said at a news conference   at the same time  it is clear that it is impossible to resolve the problem of the korean peninsula only by sanctions and pressure   he said  no headway could be made without political and diplomatic tools  putin said  moon  who took office this year advocating a policy of pursuing engagement with north korea  has come under increasing pressure to take a harder line  he has asked the united nations to consider tough new sanctions after north korea s latest nuclear test  the united states wants the security council to impose an oil embargo on north korea  ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of north korean laborers abroad and subject leader kim jong un to an asset freeze and travel ban  according to a draft resolution seen by reuters on wednesday  diplomats say the u n  security council could also consider barring the country s airline   i ask russia to actively cooperate as this time it is inevitable that north korea s oil supply should be cut at the least   moon told putin  according to a readout from a south korean official  putin said north korea would not give up its nuclear program no matter how tough the sanctions     we too  are against north korea developing its nuclear capabilities and condemn it  but it is worrying cutting the oil pipeline will harm the regular people  like in hospitals   putin said  according to the south korean presidential official   russia s exports of crude oil to north korea were tiny at about   tonnes a year  putin said  by comparison  china provides it with about   tonnes of crude a year  according to industry sources  last year  china shipped just over   tonnes of gasoline and almost   tonnes of diesel to north korea  where it is used across the economy  from fishermen and farmers to truckers and the military  trump and british prime minister theresa may agreed in a telephone call on tuesday that china must do more to persuade north korea to cease its missile tests  a spokesman for may said  sanctions have done little to stop north korea boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with trump  who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the u s  mainland with a nuclear weapon  china and russia have advocated a  freeze for freeze  plan  where the united states and south korea stop major military exercises in exchange for north korea halting its weapons programs  but neither side is willing to budge  north korea says it needs to develop its weapons to defend itself against what it sees as u s  aggression  south korea and the united states are technically still at war with north korea after the   korean conflict ended with a truce  not a peace treaty  china objects to both the military drills and the

nuclear test that intensified the pressure on his young presidency  trump s handling of pyongyang s nuclear test reflected a more traditional approach to crisis management  which u s  officials said illustrated the influence of the new white house chief of staff  retired marine corps general john kelly  and defense secretary jim mattis  that included the tone the president struck in some early

president has sometimes chafed at the restrictions his new chief of staff has imposed on the information flow in and out of the oval office in a bid to streamline the decision making process  people familiar with the situation said   you can t manage trump like that   said one outside trump adviser  who predicted the president would eventually tire of the process  a second official familiar with the situation noted that  kelly s influence extends so far    the president is still the commander in chief  and he has his bully pulpit in twitter   said that official  who also requested anonymity to discuss internal white house matters  if there was a discordant note on sunday  it might have been when trump took to twitter to admonish south korea  a key ally  for what he termed a policy of  appeasement  of north korea   south korea is finding  as i have told them  that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work  they  north korea  only understand one thing   he said on twitter  a former senior state department official criticized trump for making the remark   it was unseemly  unhelpful  and divisive to gratuitously slap our major ally at the very moment when the threat from  north korea  has reached a new height   said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  mattis has a closer relationship with trump than do kelly  national security adviser h r  mcmaster and tillerson  and had played the leading role in explaining to the president the military options and the dangerous implications of using any of them  the second u s  official said   it s no accident that it was mattis who spoke to the media after the meeting   the official said   both officials said trump had been briefed on north korea multiple times since taking office in january  but had pushed back against the idea that military action would be so costly that it should remain a last resort  most military scenarios predict that a strike on north korea would bring a massive missile and artillery response against south korea and its capital  seoul  resulting in mass casualties  for now  the strategy emerging in the white house includes greater economic pressure on china to step in to help resolve the crisis  officials said  beijing denies it has sufficient influence on pyongyang  the effort was signaled by treasury secretary steven mnuchin  who told  fox news sunday  that he was drafting a sanctions package in which  anybody who wants to do trade or business with them  north korea  would be prevented from doing trade or business with us   china is north korea s biggest trading partner  a recent round of u s  sanctions targeted some chinese financial institutions  but administration officials said a broader effort was being contemplated  whether trump would launch such an effort is far from clear  he has sought to impose tariffs against chinese steel imports but has been persuaded by his advisers not to take such a step because it could start a trade war  ,Not

prevent him and hundreds of fellow prisoners in the quezon city jail from sleeping on plywood mats in an outdoor hallway  the cells themselves are overflowing with an influx of detainees from president rodrigo duterte s year long war on drugs  thousands of people have been killed in duterte s campaign  mainly drug users and small time peddlers  tens of thousands of others have been thrown into jail  and both prisons and courts in the southeast asian nation are creaking under the pressure   since the war on drugs started  it became harder to sleep   lacanilao told a reuters team allowed access to the quezon city jail   we have no place to go to when it rains   the  year old is facing trial on a drugs charge  the prison was initially built for  inmates  but now has    three quarters of them jailed for drug related offences   at night  its basketball court  chapel  classrooms and walkways become sleeping areas for detainees  inmates who spoke to reuters said living conditions were unbearable  made worse by the prospect that it could be years before their trials are decided  many of them are not eligible for bail or cannot afford to pay the bond   prisoners came in one after the other  if you have money  you can buy a spot in the sleeping quarters   said junjun vallecer  who says he has been in the jail for four years for possession of drugs but is still being tried  he says he has to wait four to six months between court appearances  the bureau of jail management and penology  bjmp  put the prison population in the country  including undertrials and convicts  at   as of the end of june  up  percent since duterte took office at the end of june last year   police and the philippine drug enforcement agency arrested   suspected pushers  users and chemists from july last year until earlier this month  according to police data  a staggering  percent of people jailed for drug offences are still undertrials  according to bjmp  police in manila arrest nearly  drug suspects each day  says oscar albayalde  the capital s police chief    whether they are minor charges or not  we have to arrest these people   albayalde told reuters   we make these arrests that contribute to the over congestion of the detention cells     but what can we do   including a backlog  the bjmp says   narcotics cases were at trial or being processed as of june  most of the cases are defended by the public attorney s office  pao   a legal aid agency attached to the department of justice  at the end of   the agency had a backlog of   drugs cases  compared to about   at the end of june   just before duterte unleashed his fierce anti drugs campaign   the agency says it has   lawyers to handle a total of   criminal cases currently pending  meaning an average of  cases for each

colleagues anymore   the  year old  in her first year as a trial lawyer  told reuters she attends more than a dozen court hearings a day   in the morning  we attend court hearings and in the afternoon  we prepare pleadings and meet clients  i go to jails to prepare our defense   boxloads of documents are piled up inside the pao s office in quezon city  most are related to cases  but some are applications for about  new positions the government has agreed to create in the agency in the next two years to handle the overflow of cases  typically  trials in the philippines begin some years

showed  one philippine prison officer watches over  prisoners on average  far from the stipulated one to seven ratio  and there are insufficient numbers of guards to escort suspects to court hearings  the data showed   the ratios are really wild   said martin perfecto  deputy director of the philippines bureau of corrections  flag lawyer alex padilla says judicial reform is not a priority in the

manila  reuters    philippine teenager kian loyd delos santos told friends he dreamed of becoming a policeman after graduating from high school   last week  plain clothes policemen dragged the  year old to a dark  trash filled alley in northern manila  shot him in the head and left his body next to a pigsty  according to witnesses whose accounts appeared to be backed up by cctv footage  the killing has electrified the philippines  sparked multiple investigations and galvanized what had previously been limited opposition to president rodrigo duterte s war on drugs  thousands of people have been killed since he took office  months ago  police said they shot delos santos in self defense after he opened fire on officers during an anti drugs operation  but there was outrage when the cctv footage emerged showing two officers marching a figure  subdued and apparently unarmed  toward the spot where the youth s body was later found  three officers  who police say have been confined to quarters in a manila police camp  are now defending their actions in a senate inquiry that began on thursday  they maintain delos santos fired at them  the teenager s parents and the philippines public attorney s office  a government legal aid agency  have filed murder charges against the policemen at the justice department   let us allow the formal criminal investigation to proceed and not rush into conclusion or judgment  let us allow the personnel involved to have their day in court and defend themselves   philippines national police spokesman dionardo carlos said when asked about the case       reuters journalists spoke to at least two dozen witnesses  friends and neighbors of delos santos in manila s caloocan area about his killing  they said he was a kind  popular teenager who liked to joke around and didn t drink or do drugs  he was too poor to own a gun  they said   we no longer have our joker   said one of his friends  sharmaine joy adante    she said delos santos had wanted to join the police so that his mother  who works in saudi arabia  could afford to live in her own country  nearby  at the entrance to his family s tiny home  delos santos lay in an open coffin  among the tributes placed on its lid was a crumpled playing card   a joker   and a live chick to symbolically peck away at the conscience of his killers  some locals said they feared reprisals from the police for speaking out and asked reuters to withhold their second names  it was after  p m  on august  when erwin lachica    a welder  said he saw three men in civilian clothes enter the area on two motorbikes  all three had handguns tucked into their waistbands  he said  lachica recognized them as officers from previous police operations in the neighborhood  they were later identified as arnel oares  jeremias pereda and jerwin cruz  according to a police report issued a day after the killing  when the teenager saw officers approaching  he immediately drew a weapon and shot at them  oares  who led the operation  returned fire and killed him  it said   it was dark  he fired at us   pereda told the senate inquiry this week   we knew it was a gun  there was a loud sound  we saw a gleam of light   police have cited self defense as the pretext for killing more than   people in drug war operations since duterte came to power  lachica had a different version of events  he said delos santos was standing outside a shop when the men grabbed him  and then slapped and punched him until he started crying  no gunbattle took place  he said   he was saying he was innocent  he was not a drug addict   added lachica  who said the men put delos santos in a headlock and dragged him away  cctv footage from a neighborhood security camera shows two men marching someone  his head bowed  through a nearby basketball court  a third man follows  the officers told the senate that they were indeed in the video but were bundling away an informant  not delos santos  multiple witnesses  however  told reuters they recognized the youth  one of those witnesses was victor  a teenage student  who said he knew delos santos because he lived in the neighborhood  he said the men hustled delos santos across the basketball court and down a path to the filthy  flood prone tullahan river  victor dared not follow   we were very scared   he recalled  his eyes filling with tears  delos santos  life ended in a dark nook next to a disused pigsty by the river  a few paces away  a  year old construction worker called rene was eating dinner with his two daughters in his home  first  said rene  he heard shouting   a man ordering residents to stay inside their houses   then two bursts of gunfire  perhaps  shots in all   we hid under the table   he said   we didn t even peek out the window   three other residents told reuters they heard between seven and nine shots  others said they heard nothing at all  manila slums are seething  raucous places  where even gunfire can be drowned out  autopsies by the police and the public attorney s office disagreed on the number of gunshot wounds delos santos sustained  but pathologists for both told the senate that he was kneeling when shot   you are not allowed to kill a person that is kneeling down begging for his life  that is murder   duterte said in a speech on wednesday  duterte s supporters have taken to blogs and social media to express support for the police and raise doubts about delos santos  innocence  but the killing appears to have kindled grave concerns among  the public because of the age of the victim and because the video supported witness accounts of his killing  it has also fueled longstanding public anxiety about the drug war s brutal methods  and could generate wider opposition to a campaign whose critics have so far been largely limited to priests  activists  lawyers and a handful of prominent politicians  still  duterte remains popular  said ramon casiple  executive director of the manila based institute for political and electoral reform   it s not really a tipping point   he said   but duterte is vulnerable  his popularity will take a hit   delos santos  death was the culmination of a spike in killings across the philippines  main island  luzon  that same night  police shot dead at least  people in manila during multiple operations to crack down on drugs and crime  two nights before that  in bulacan province  just north of the capital  police killed  people  some rights activists saw the upsurge as a government bid to regain credibility lost after duterte s recent admission that no president could solve the drug problem in a single term  he had originally vowed to end it within six months of taking office  many critics question the drug war s focus on killing petty users and dealers from poor communities  rather than nabbing the kingpins who supply them with crystal meth  a highly addictive stimulant known locally as  shabu  that officials blame for high crime rates and other social ills  in a speech this week  duterte said he had told his police chief to jail the officers involved in the delos santos killing until an inquiry was conducted  he also vowed to continue the drug war   if you want  shoot me  but i will not change my policy   he said later  presidential spokesman ernesto abella told reuters that there were lessons to be learned from the events       kian s case is a wake up call for the need to reform government institutions  even law enforcement agencies   he said  for a graphic on death of a schoolboy  click  here ,Not A Fake

vienna  reuters    the united states is pushing u n  nuclear inspectors to check  military sites in iran to verify it is not breaching its nuclear deal with world powers  but for this to happen  inspectors must believe such checks are necessary and so far they do not  officials say  last week  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley visited the international atomic energy agency  iaea   which is scrutinizing compliance with the  agreement  as part of a review of the pact by the administration of president donald trump  he has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated   after her talks with officials of the u n  nuclear watchdog  haley said   there are    numerous undeclared sites that have not been inspected  that is a problem   iran dismissed her demands as  merely a dream   the iaea has the authority to request access to facilities in iran  including military ones  if there are new and credible indications of banned nuclear activities there  according to officials from the agency and signatories to the deal  but they said washington has not provided such indications to back up its pressure on the iaea to make such a request   we re not going to visit a military site like parchin just to send a political signal   an iaea official said  mentioning a military site often cited by opponents of the deal including iran s arch adversary israel and many u s  republicans  the deal was struck under trump s democratic predecessor barack obama  iaea director general yukiya amano frequently describes his vienna based agency as a technical rather than a political one  underscoring the need for its work to be based on facts alone  the accord restricts iran s atomic activities with a view to keeping the islamic republic a year s work away from having enough enriched uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb  should it pull out of the accord and sprint towards making a weapon   the deal also allows the iaea to request access to facilities other than the nuclear installations iran has already declared if it has concerns about banned materials or activities there  but it must present a basis for those concerns   those terms are widely understood by officials from the iaea and member states to mean there must be credible information that arouses suspicion  and iaea officials have made clear they will not take it at face value    we have to be able to vet this information   a second iaea official said  asking not to be identified because inspections are sensitive and the agency rarely discusses them publicly  despite haley s public comments  she neither asked the iaea to visit specific sites nor offered new intelligence on any site  officials who attended her meetings said  a u s  state department spokesman confirmed this   she conveyed that the iaea will need to continue to robustly exercise its authorities to verify iran s declaration and monitor the joint comprehensive plan of action   the spokesman added  using the deal s official name  under u s  law  the state department must notify congress every  days of iran s compliance with the deal  the next deadline is october  trump has said he thinks by then washington will declare iran to be non compliant   a stance at odds with that of other five world powers including u s  allies in europe  an iaea report published in  as part of the deal formally drew a line under whether iran pursued nuclear weapons in the past  which is why new information is needed to trigger a request for access   the iaea has not visited an iranian military facility since the agreement was implemented because it has had  no reason to ask  for access  the second agency official said   the deal s  access  section lays out a process that begins with an iaea request and  if the u n  watchdog s concerns are not resolved  can lead to a vote by the eight members of the deal s decision making body   the united states  iran  russia  china  france  britain  germany and the european union   five votes are needed for a majority  which could comprise the united states and its western allies  such a majority decision  would advise on the necessary means to resolve the iaea s concerns  and iran  would implement the necessary means   the deal s access section says  that process and wording have yet to be put to the test  iran has reiterated commitment to the terms of the deal despite trump s stance  but has also said its military sites are off limits  raising the risk of a stand off if a request for access were put to a vote  that adds to the pressure to be clear on the grounds for an initial request   if they want to bring down the deal  they will   the first iaea official said  referring to the trump administration   we just don t want to give them an excuse to   during its decade long impasse with world powers over its nuclear program  iran repeatedly refused iaea visits to military sites  saying they had nothing to do with nuclear activity and so were beyond the iaea s purview  shortly after the  deal  iran allowed inspectors to check its parchin military complex  where western security services believe tehran carried out tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations more than a decade ago  iran has denied this  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

hanoi  reuters    tensions are high on the south china sea as vietnam faces off against china over their overlapping maritime claims  but for the boatmen on the junks cruising the calm expanse of vietnam s ha long bay  another growing chinese presence in the region is very welcome indeed   more than half our tourists are chinese now   said nguyen van phu    who has spent six years working on the boats that chug between the bay s spectacular stone towers   if they stopped coming it would be a big problem  if not a disaster   the number of chinese tourists in vietnam has surged this year  just one sign of the growing economic ties between two long time enemies  chinese investment in vietnam is also increasing rapidly  as is trade between the two countries  but while tourists  trade and investment are being welcomed  they also present a challenge for a fiercely independent country like vietnam  which has been wary of china s growing influence in the region   the rising economic dependence on china makes it more difficult for vietnam to decide how far to confront china on the south china sea   said nguyen khac giang  a researcher at the vietnam economics and policy research institution   vietnam would suffer far more than china economically in the event of political instability given its smaller size  he said  china exports more goods to vietnam than any other country in southeast asia  sending textiles to be made into shirts and sneakers  and electronic components for mobile phones and large flat panel displays  those completed products are exported around the world  as well as back to china      vietnam also makes electronics components for factories in china  and exports computers for chinese consumers  manufacturers see vietnam as an attractive base  with wages as little as a third of those in coastal regions of china  according to employment consultants  and while proximity has historically been a source of friction between the two countries   they fought a border war as recently as  and armed clashes flared for years afterwards   for manufacturers it s a boon   we strategically invested in vietnam because of its geographical advantage   closer to china and hence lower cost on materials  transportation and relatively shorter production lead time   said bosco law  chief executive of the hong kong based lawsgroup  the company makes clothes for brands such as gap  whose global operations include scores of outlets in china  businesses contacted by reuters declined to talk openly about the risks for them of tension between vietnam and china  chinese trade and investment has surged across southeast asia in recent years as companies search out new bases for manufacturing and consumers for their goods   china has also invested in infrastructure and plans to pour development funds into southeast asia as part of its sprawling belt and road initiative  that has already had a political effect   big recipients of chinese investment such as cambodia and laos are promoting china s line on the south china sea at regional meetings   president rodrigo duterte of the philippines  meanwhile  has cited chinese investment pledges as he softens his country s stance on its maritime disputes with china  tensions between beijing and hanoi have been high since mid june  when chinese pressure forced vietnam to suspend oil drilling on a block that overlaps the line china says marks its claim to almost all the south china sea  as vietnam has emerged as the most vocal regional opponent of china s maritime claims in southeast asia  it has drawn beijing s ire  its growing defense links to the united states  japan and india also make china suspicious  the vietnamese government has also had to contend with public pressure at home  a row over chinese oil drilling in disputed waters in the south china sea in  sparked anti china riots in vietnam in which foreign factories thought to be chinese were set on fire  before the rig was removed  tourism dipped in the aftermath  but quickly bounced back  trade has also risen steadily since then    exports to china jumped nearly  percent to   billion in the first half of  from a year earlier  according to customs data  imports rose more slowly  climbing  percent  chinese tourist arrivals  meanwhile  soared  percent to nearly   million in the first half of  to account for around one third of all foreign visitors  for the most part  the government has welcomed the boost from chinese tourism  as it strives to meet a   percent target for annual economic growth  vietnam is also welcoming chinese investments  if cautiously    we should be careful but at the same time we should take advantage   said nguyen mai  the president of vietnam s association of foreign invested enterprises  the biggest foreign direct investors in vietnam have long been from south korea and japan  particularly in the electronics sector  more than   vietnamese work for samsung alone in vietnam  however  chinese investment is growing quickly  nearly doubling last year to almost  percent of total foreign direct investment  investment went into solar panel and plastics factories  among other areas  direct u s  investment accounts for about  percent of the total so far this year  the united states is also vietnam s second largest trade partner  for a graphic on vietnam china trade  click  tmsnrt

varna  bulgaria warsaw  reuters    french president emmanuel macron said on friday poland was isolating itself within the european union and polish citizens  deserve better  than a government at odds with the bloc s democratic values and economic reform plans    macron said warsaw  where a nationalist  eurosceptic government took office in   was moving in the opposite direction to europe on numerous issues and would not be able to dictate the path of europe s future  poland rejected the accusations  saying macron was inexperienced and arrogant   europe is a region created on the basis of values  a relationship with democracy and public freedoms which poland is today in conflict with   macron said in bulgaria on the third leg of a trip to central and eastern europe to generate support for his vision of a europe that better protects its citizens   he described poland s refusal to change its stance on a revision of the eu s directive on  posted  workers   cheap labor from eastern countries posted temporarily to more affluent western countries   as a mistake  macron has said the practice leads to unfair competition   in no way will the decision by a country that has decided to isolate itself in the workings of europe jeopardize the finding of an ambitious compromise   he said    in a scathing attack that could drag relations between western eu powers and the european commission in brussels on one side and poland s law and justice party  pis  government on the other to a new low  he said the polish people deserved better   poland is not defining europe s future today and nor will it define the europe of tomorrow   macron said at a joint press conference with bulgarian president rumen radev in the black sea resort city of varna  in response  poland s prime minister beata szydlo said macron    a former investment banker elected in may as france s youngest president  lacked political experience and accused him of undermining the eu   i advise the president that he should be more conciliatory     perhaps his arrogant comments are a result of a lack of  political  experience   szydlo said in a statement emailed to reuters   i advise the president that he should focus on the affairs of his own country  perhaps he may be able to achieve the same economic results and the same level of security for  french  citizens as those guaranteed by poland   her comments were an indirect reference to her government s insistence that it will not accept migrants from the middle east  despite pressure from brussels  because it believes they pose a threat to national security  france has been hit hard by deadly islamist militant attacks in recent years  the polish foreign ministry said in a statement it had urgently summoned the french charg  d affaires to express  the polish government s indignation about the arrogant words  of macron  it quoted deputy foreign minister marek magierowski as saying poland  expects that france will abandon language that is divisive and which damages the unity of the eu    relations between szydlo s law and justice  pis  party and the french government deteriorated soon after it won election in late   in october   poland abruptly canceled a nearly   billion military procurement deal with airbus  macron s election deepened the rift  with the french globalization advocate fanning worries in warsaw that his vision of a  multi speed  europe would undermine polish influence within the european union  french officials have expressed concerns about poland  and hungary  drifting towards authoritarianism and said macron would also make a defense of the rule of law and democratic principles one of the priorities of his mandate on the european stage   on his three day tour macron sought backing for his plans to tighten eu rules on the employment abroad of labor from low pay nations  poland strongly opposes this initiative  while  posted  workers comprise less than  percent of the eu work force  it is a political hot potato that has exacerbated the divide between the bloc s poor east and rich west for years  macron managed to enlist the broad support of czech republic and slovakia  and the lukewarm backing of romania  all countries which fear being sidelined in a multi speed eu  whereas poland and hungary remain defiant of what they see as an out of touch eu elite based in brussels and western capitals  poland is at loggerheads with the european commission  the brussels based eu executive  over issues ranging from its refusal to accept eu migrant relocation quotas to the ruling conservatives  tightening grip on the judiciary and media   macron shunned both poland and hungary on his trip through the region   he said he wanted bulgaria   like poland  hungary  romania  the czech republic and slovakia a former communist state that joined the eu much later than western counterparts   to be at the negotiating table on european integration  on the posted worker rules  bulgaria s radev said the eu needed to balance the interests of countries in the rich west and the poor east   it is important that changes are made in a way that unites rather than divides europe   he said   current eu rules allow workers to be posted from low salary countries to other eu states on contracts that must guarantee the host country s minimum wage  but under which taxes and social charges are paid in the home nation   poland and hungary say increased restrictions on such contracts would flout the principles of the european single market and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs

seoul  reuters    south korea braced for a possible further missile test by north korea as it marked its founding anniversary on saturday  just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region   throughout the week  south korean officials have warned the north could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile  in defiance of u n  sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the united states  pyongyang marks its founding anniversary each year with a big display of pageantry and military hardware  last year  north korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on the sept   anniversary  tension on the korean peninsula has escalated as north korea s young leader  kim jong un  has stepped up the development of weapons  testing a string of missiles this year  including one flying over japan  and conducting its sixth nuclear test on sunday  experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states  something u s  president donald trump has vowed to prevent  celebrating its founding anniversary  a front page editorial of the saturday edition of north korea s official rodong sinmun said the country should make  more high tech juche weapons to continuously bring about big historical events such as a miraculous victory of july     the july date refers to the intercontinental ballistic missile test   juche is north korea s homegrown ideology of self reliance that is a mix of marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder kim il sung  the current leader s grandfather       south korean nuclear experts  checking for contamination  said on friday they had found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to link it to sunday s explosion  the nuclear safety and security commission  nssc  said it had been conducting tests on land  air and water samples since shortly after the north korean nuclear test on sunday  xenon is a naturally occurring  colourless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights  but the nssc said it had detected xenon   a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to north korea s nuclear tests  there was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on south korea s territory or population   the agency said  trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with north korea and on thursday said he would prefer not to use military action  but if he did  it would be a  very sad day  for north korea   military action would certainly be an option  is it inevitable  nothing is inevitable   trump told reporters   if we do use it on north korea  it will be a very sad day for north korea   even as trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk  senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution is open  especially given the u s  assessment that any pre emptive strike would unleash massive north korean retaliation  north korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from u s  aggression and regularly threatens to destroy the united states   south korea and the united states are technically still at war with north korea after the   korean conflict ended with a truce  not a peace treaty  the uss ronald reagan  a nuclear powered carrier  left its home port in japan for a routine autumn patrol of the western pacific  a navy spokeswoman said  that area included waters between japan and the korean peninsula  she added  without giving any further details   the ronald reagan was out on routine patrol from may until august  and was sent to the sea of japan with the another carrier  the uss carl vinson  to take part in drills with japan s self defense forces as well as the south korean military   north korea vehemently objects to military exercises on or near the peninsula  and china and russia have suggested the united states and south korea halt their exercises to lower tension  while trump talked tough on north korea  china agreed on thursday that the united nations should take more action against it  but it also pushed for dialogue  the u n  security council is expected to vote on a new set of sanctions soon  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that it was too early to draw conclusions about the final form of the u n  resolution  russia s interfax news agency quoted lavrov as saying at a news conference on friday  the united states on friday told the u n  security council that it intends to call a meeting on monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on north korea for its missile and nuclear program  the u s  mission to the united nations said in a statement  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said last monday that she intended to call for a vote on sept   and then the united states circulated a draft resolution to the  member council on wednesday  the united states wants the security council to impose an oil embargo on north korea  ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of north korean laborers abroad  and to subject kim jong un to an asset freeze and travel ban  according to a draft resolution seen by reuters on wednesday  it was not immediately clear how north korean allies china and russia would vote  but a senior u s  official on friday night expressed scepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of north korean textiles  chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor   north korea offered fresh vitriol against the pending sanctions  specifically targeting haley  who this week accused kim of  begging for war    there is nothing more foolish than thinking we  a strong nuclear state  will endure this evil pressure aimed at overthrowing our state   the north s official news agency said in a commentary   even if nikki haley is blind  she must use her mouth correctly  the united states administration will pay for not being able to control the mouth of their u

seoul washington  reuters    north korea fired several short range missiles into the sea off its east coast early on saturday  south korea and the u s  military said  as the two allies conducted annual joint military drills that the north denounces as preparation for war  the u s  military s pacific command said it had detected three short range ballistic missiles  fired over a  minute period   one appeared to have blown up almost immediately while two flew about  km   miles  in a northeasterly direction  pacific command said  revising an earlier assessment that two of the missiles had failed in flight  the test came just days after senior u s  officials praised north korea and leader kim jong un for showing restraint in not firing any missiles since late july   the south korean office of the joint chiefs of staff said the projectiles were launched from the north s eastern kangwon province into the sea  later on saturday  the south korean presidential blue house said the north may have fired an upgraded  mm caliber multiple rocket launcher but the military was still analyzing the precise details of the projectiles   pacific command said the missiles did not pose a threat to the u s  mainland or to the pacific territory of guam  which north korea had threatened earlier this month to surround in a  sea of fire   tensions had eased somewhat since a harsh exchange of words between pyongyang and washington after u s  president donald trump had warned north korean leader kim jong un he would face  fire and fury  if he threatened the united states  north korea s last missile test on july  was for an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to fly   km    miles   that would put parts of the u s  mainland within reach and prompted heated exchanges that raised fears of a new conflict on the peninsula  japan s chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said the missiles did not reach its territory or exclusive economic zone and did not pose a threat to japan s safety   the south korean and u s  militaries are in the midst of the annual ulchi freedom guardian drills involving computer simulations of a war to test readiness and run until aug    the region where the missiles were launched  kittaeryong  is a known military test site frequently used by the north for short range missile drills  said kim dong yub  a military expert at the institute for far eastern studies in seoul    so rather than a newly developed missile  it looks to be short range missiles they fired as part of their summer exercise and also in response to the ulchi freedom guardian drill   he said  the united states and south korea are technically still at war with the north because their   conflict ended in a truce  not a peace treaty  the north routinely says it will never give up its weapons programs  saying they are necessary to counter perceived u s  hostility  washington has repeatedly urged china  north korea s main ally and trading partner  to do more to rein in pyongyang  china s commerce ministry late on friday banned north korean individuals and enterprises from doing new business in china  in line with united nations security council sanctions passed earlier this month  the white house said trump had been briefed about the latest missiles but did not immediately have further comment  the u s  state department did not immediately comment about the saturday launches  secretary of state rex tillerson earlier this week credited the north with showing restraint by not launching a missile since the july icbm test  tillerson had said he hoped that the lack of missile launches or other  provocative acts  by pyongyang could mean a path could be opening for dialogue  sometime in the near future    trump also expressed optimism earlier this week about a possible improvement in relations   i respect the fact that he is starting to respect us   trump said of kim          north korea s state media reported on saturday that kim had guided a contest of amphibious landing and aerial strike by its army against targets modeled after south korean islands near the sea border on the west coast  the official kcna news agency quoted kim as telling its army that it  should think of mercilessly wiping out the enemy with arms only and occupying seoul at one go and the southern half of korea   a new poster on a north korean propaganda website on saturday showed a missile dealing  a retaliatory strike of justice  against the u s  mainland  threatening to  wipe out the united states  the source of evil  without a trace     on wednesday  kim ordered the production of more rocket engines and missile warheads during a visit to a facility associated with north korea s ballistic missile program   diagrams and what appeared to be missile parts shown in photographs published in the north s state media suggested pyongyang was pressing ahead with building a longer range ballistic missile that could potentially reach any part

yangon  reuters    when the former u n  chief kofi annan wrapped up his year long probe into myanmar s troubled northwest on aug    he publicly warned that an excessive army response to violence would only make a simmering conflict between rohingya insurgents and myanmar security forces worse  just three hours later  shortly after  p m   rohingya insurgent leader ata ullah sent a message to his supporters urging them to head to the foot of the remote mayu mountain range with metal objects to use as weapons  a little after midnight   km northwest of the country s largest city yangon  a rag tag army of rohingya militants  wielding knives  sticks  small weapons and crude bombs  attacked  police posts and an army base   if  or  people come out   will die  god willing  the remaining  can kill them with knives   said ata ullah in a separate voice message to his supporters  it was circulated around the time of the offensive on mobile messaging apps and a recording was subsequently reviewed by reuters  the assault by ata ullah s group  the arakan rohingya salvation army  arsa   was its biggest yet  last october  when the group first surfaced  it attacked just three police border posts using about  fighters  according to myanmar government estimates  the myanmar army is now estimating up to   people took part in the august offensive  its ability to mount a much more ambitious assault indicates that many young rohingya men have been galvanized into supporting arsa following the army crackdown after the october attacks  according to interviews with more than a dozen rohingya and rakhine villagers  members of the security forces and local administrators  the brutal october response led to allegations that troops burned down villages and killed and raped civilians  the crisis in ethnically riven rakhine state is the biggest to face myanmar s leader aung san suu kyi  and her handling of it has been a source of disillusionment among the democracy champion s former supporters in the west  united nations secretary general antonio guterres appealed to myanmar authorities on tuesday to end violence against rohingya muslims  warning of the risk of ethnic cleansing  a possible humanitarian catastrophe  and regional destabilisation  rohingya leaders and some policy analysts say suu kyi s failure to tackle the grievances of the muslim minority  who have lived under apartheid like conditions for generations  has bolstered support for the militants  the fledgling militia has been transformed into a network of cells in dozens of villages  capable of staging a widespread offensive  myanmar s government has declared arsa a terrorist organisation  it has also accused it of killing muslim civilians to prevent them from cooperating with the authorities  and of torching rohingya villages  allegations the group denies  the latest assault has provoked a major counteroffensive in which the military says it killed almost  insurgents and in which  members of the security forces have died  rohingya villagers and human rights groups say the military has also attacked villages indiscriminately and torched homes  myanmar government says it is carrying out a lawful counter terrorism operation and that the troops have been instructed not to harm civilians   nearly   rohingya have fled to bangladesh since aug    leading to fears of a humanitarian crisis  some   non muslim villagers have also been displaced inside myanmar  suu kyi has said she would adopt recommendations of kofi annan s panel that encouraged more integration  she has also previously appealed for understanding of her nation s ethnic complexities  in a statement on wednesday  she blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in rakhine  she made no mention of the rohingya who have fled  suu kyi s spokesman  zaw htay  could not be immediately reached for comment   on monday  however  he told reuters myanmar was carrying out a counterterrorism operation and taking care of  the safety of civilians  including muslims and non muslims   in an interview with reuters in march  ata ullah linked the creation of the group to communal violence between buddhists and muslims in rakhine in   when nearly  people were killed and    mostly rohingya  displaced   we can t turn the lights on at night  we can t move from one place to another during the day   he told reuters in previously unpublished remarks  referring to restrictions placed on the rohingya population s behaviour and movements   everywhere checkpoints  every entry and every exit  that s not how humans live   a rohingya community leader who has stayed in northern rakhine said that  while the rest of myanmar enjoyed new freedoms under suu kyi after decades of military rule  the muslim minority have been increasingly marginalized  support for the insurgents grew after the military operation last year  he said   when the security forces came to our village  all of the villagers apologised and asked them not to set the houses on fire   but they shot the people who made that request   he said   people suffered because their sons got killed in front of them even though they begged for mercy  their daughters  sisters were raped   how could they live without constantly thinking about it  that they want to fight against it  whether they die or not   reuters couldn t independently confirm the villagers  accounts  last month  a myanmar government probe   led by former head of military intelligence and now vice president  myint swe   rejected allegations of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing during the crackdown last year   villagers and police officers in the area say that arsa had since last october established cells in dozens of villages  where local activists then recruited others   people shared their feelings with others from the community  they talked to each other  they told their friends or acquaintances from different regions   and then they exploded   said the rohingya community leader  rohi mullarah  a village elder from the kyee hnoke thee village in northern buthidaung  said the leaders sent their followers regular and frequent messages via apps like whatsapp and wechat  encouraging them to fight for freedom and human rights and enabling them to mobilize many people without the risk of being caught going into the heavily militarised areas to recruit   they mainly sent phone messages to the villagers  they didn t     move people from place to place   he said  he said his village was not involved in the insurgency and even posted a signboard in front of it that said any militants would be attacked by the villagers if they attempt to recruit people  many rohingya elders have for decades rejected violence and sought dialogue with the government  while arsa has now gained some influence  especially among young  disaffected men  many rohingya elders have condemned the group s violent tactics  in recent months there had been reports of killings of local administrators  government informers and village chiefs in the rakhine region  leading to speculation the insurgents were adopting brutal tactics to stop information on their activities from leaking to the security forces   they cut out the government communication by instigating a campaign of fear and took charge in the region   said sein lwin  police chief in rakhine    an army source directly involved in operations in northern rakhine also said it was now much more difficult to get information on arsa s plans   the strategy resulted in the  shut down of government mechanisms  in some places  because no government servants dared to stay there   the army source said  a village head from northern buthidaung township  who asked not to be named  said the insurgents called him several times pressing him to allow some young villagers to take part in their training   an offer he refused   i tried to stay safe and sometimes i had to sleep at the police station and local administrator s house   he said  despite the largely successful clamp down on information by the insurgents  it was a tip off by an informer that stopped the aug   attacks from being much worse for the myanmar security services  the army source said    about an hour after ata ullah s men headed for the jungle in the evening of aug    the army received a signal from the rohingya informer saying the attack was coming  the  p m  message mentioned imminent multiple attacks  but it did not say where they would occur  the warning was enough for the security forces to withdraw some troops to larger stations and to reinforce strategic locations  saving many lives on the government side  the military source said  the raids by the insurgents came in waves from around  a m  until sunrise  and took place mostly in maungdaw township where ata ullah staged his three attacks in october  this time  though  the distance between the northern  and southern most points was as long as  km   miles   the rohingya also struck in the north of the neighbouring buthidaung township  including an audacious bid to storm an army base   we were surprised they attacked across such a wide geographical area   it shook the whole region   said the army source   this version of the story corrects date in paragraph  to aug    ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake

foreign owned social media  vietnam s president tran dai quang this month called for unspecified tougher internet controls in the face of  hostile forces  that he said threatened not only

vietnam tried to pressure facebook  fb o  and google  googl o  to take down thousands items of anti government content in march by leaning on advertisers  but the continued prevalence suggests limited success  one reason it is hard to take tougher action is business  from brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing vietnam s streets  social media is a key marketing route to young

istanbul  reuters    u s  prosecutors have charged a former turkish economy minister and the ex head of a state owned bank with conspiring to violate iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the u s  financial system on tehran s behalf  the indictment marks the first time an ex government member with close ties to president tayyip erdogan has been charged in an investigation that has strained ties between washington and ankara  ex minister zafer caglayan was also charged with taking bribes in cash and jewelry worth tens of millions of dollars  the charges stem from the case against reza zarrab  a wealthy turkish iranian gold trader who was arrested in the united states over sanctions evasion last year  erdogan has said u s  authorities had  ulterior motives  in charging zarrab  who has pleaded not guilty  prosecutors have now charged caglayan and former halkbank general manager suleyman aslan and two others  according to the u s  attorney s office for the southern district of new york  they were charged with  conspiring to use the u s  financial system to conduct hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of transactions on behalf of the government of iran and other iranian entities  which were barred by united states sanctions   u s  prosecutors said in a statement dated wednesday  they were also accused of lying to u s  government officials about the transactions  laundering funds and defrauding several financial institutions by concealing the true nature of the transactions  prosecutors said  reuters was not immediately able to reach caglayan or aslan for comment  halkbank said all of its transactions have always fully complied with national and international regulations  adding that news regarding the u s  case  misleads  the public and investors  relations between washington and nato ally turkey  an important partner in tackling the syrian conflict  were strained after a failed coup against erdogan in july last year and the president s subsequent crackdown on opposition  ankara is seeking  so far without success  extradition of a u s  based muslim cleric it accuses of backing the coup attempt  the cleric  fethullah gulen  denies the allegation  economy minister nihat zeybekci defended his predecessor and said u s  prosecutors had yet to prove their accusations   caglayan did not do anything against turkey s interests   zeybekci told reporters   it is no concern to turkey if caglayan acted against interests of other countries   both caglayan and aslan are also accused of taking bribes  according to the indictment   caglayan  who was serving as minister of the economy    received tens of millions of dollars  worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services to the government of iran and conceal those services from u s  government officials   prosecutors said  u s  prosecutors have said that between  and  zarrab and others worked to conceal his ability to supply currency and gold to iran through the turkish bank  avoiding u s  sanctions  as part of that scheme  zarrab and others used front companies and fake invoices to trick u s  banks into processing transactions disguised to appear as though they involved food  and thus were exempt from the sanctions  prosecutors have said  the u s  indictment echoes charges in a leaked  turkish police document  reported by reuters  which detailed allegations that a  crime organization  had helped iran exploit a loophole in western sanctions that allowed it to purchase gold with oil and gas revenues  when the west prohibited the gold trade in  as a sanctions violation  the police report alleged the network concocted records of shipments of food at preposterous volumes and prices to continue giving iran access to foreign currency  iran emerged from years of economic isolation in january   when world powers lifted the crippling sanctions in return for tehran complying with a deal to curb its nuclear ambitions  the sanctions had cut off the country of  million people from the global financial system  slashed its exports and imposed severe economic hardship on iranians   caglayan  aslan and others indicted in the case on wednesday remain at large  prosecutors said   zarrab and a halkbank deputy general manager  mehmet hakan atilla  were arrested while in the united states  zarrab was detained in march  and atilla a year later  both are scheduled to appear for trial in october  zarrab has hired former new york city mayor rudolph giuliani and former u s  attorney general michael mukasey to defend him against the charges   giuliani has said that both u s  and turkish officials remained  receptive  to a diplomatic solution due to the nature of the charges against zarrab and the importance of turkey as an ally  a decree issued two weeks ago gave erdogan authority to approve the exchange of foreigners detained or convicted in turkey with people held in other countries  in situations required by national security or national interests   shares of halkbank were down   percent at   lira as of  gmt  underperforming the benchmark bist  index  which was flat  ,Not A Fake

beirut jerusalem  reuters    israel attacked a military site in syria s hama province early on thursday  the syrian army said  and a war monitoring group said the target could be linked to chemical weapons production   the air strike killed two soldiers and caused damage near the town of masyaf  an army statement said  it warned of the  dangerous repercussions of this aggressive action to the security and stability of the region    the syrian observatory for human rights  which monitors the war  said the attack was on a facility of the scientific studies and research centre  an agency which the united states describes as syria s chemical weapons manufacturer  it came the morning after u n  investigators said the syrian government was responsible for a sarin poison gas attack in april   syria s government denies using chemical arms  in  it promised to surrender its chemical weapons  which it says it has done   the observatory said strikes also hit a military camp next to the center that was used to store ground to ground rockets and where personnel of iran and its ally  the lebanese hezbollah group  had been seen more than once   an israeli army spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of a strike in syria  syria s foreign ministry has sent letters to the u n  security council protesting against israel s  aggression  and saying anyone who attacked syrian military sites was supporting terrorism  syrian state tv reported  in an interview in israel s haaretz daily last month on his retirement  former israeli air force chief amir eshel said israel had hit arms convoys of the syrian military and its hezbollah allies nearly  times in the past five years   israel sees red lines in the shipment to hezbollah of anti aircraft missiles  precision ground to ground missiles and  chemical weapons      the reported attack took place on the  anniversary of israel s destruction of a nuclear reactor in syria    prime minister benjamin netanyahu is due to address the u n  general assembly on sept    and is widely expected to voice israel s concern over what it sees as attempts by iran to broaden its military foothold in syria and threats posed by hezbollah israeli officials have said that russia  another ally of syrian president bashar al assad  and israel maintain regular contacts to coordinate military action in syria   some israeli commentators saw the latest strike   a departure from the previous pattern of attacks on weapons convoys   as a show of israeli dissatisfaction with the united states and russia   last month  netanyahu met russian president vladimir putin  but came away without any public statement from moscow that it would curb iranian influence      hezbollah and israel fought a brief war in  in which more than   people died  both have suggested that any new conflict between them could be on a larger scale than that one   hezbollah has been one of syrian president bashar al assad s most important allies in the war and last month its leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said he had recently traveled to damascus to meet the syrian president   israel is conducting military exercises in the north of the country near the border with lebanon   yaakov amidror  a retired israeli general and former national security adviser  told reporters he assumed thursday s strike was linked to nasrallah s visit to damascus    weapons systems have been transferred from this organization  the scientific studies and research centre  into the hands of hezbollah during the years   he said   in may  an official in the military alliance backing assad said that hezbollah drew a distinction between israel striking its positions in syria and at home in lebanon   if israel strikes hezbollah in lebanon  definitely it will respond   the official said  the syrian army statement said the israeli strike came at   a m    gmt  from inside lebanese airspace  it said it had been launched in support of islamic state   jets flying over lebanon overnight broke the sound barrier and lebanese media reported that israeli warplanes had breached lebanese airspace   the observatory reported that seven people were killed or wounded in the strike    the factory that was targeted in masyaf produces the chemical weapons and barrel bombs that have killed thousands of syrian civilians   amos yadlin  a former head of israeli military intelligence  said in a tweet   the strike sent a message that israel would not let syria produce strategic weapons  would enforce its own red lines  and would not be hampered by russian air defense systems in syria  he added   the u n  commission of inquiry on syria said on wednesday a government jet dropped sarin on khan sheikhoun in idlib province in april  killing more than  civilians  and that government forces were behind at least  chemical attacks  u s  president donald trump said he had not heard a report that syria had used chemical weapons again   but nothing would change  we would be extremely upset if he was using chemical weapons   he said in response to a question at a news conference in washington   as far as syria is concerned  we have very little to do with syria

dhaka  reuters    bangladesh has proposed creating  safe zones  run by aid groups for rohingya muslims in myanmar s rakhine state to stop hundreds of thousands of refugees crossing into its territory following a military crackdown  the plan  the latest in a string of ideas floated by dhaka  is unlikely to get much traction in myanmar  where many consider the rohingya community of   million as illegal immigrants from bangladesh  that will leave bangladesh  one of the poorest nations in the world  with little choice but to open new camps for refugees    dhaka sent the proposal to the myanmar government through the international committee of the red cross to secure three areas in rakhine  home to the rohingya community  suggesting that people displaced by the violence be relocated there under the supervision of an international organization  such as the united nations    the logic of the creation of such zones is that no rohingya can come inside bangladesh   said shahidul haque  bangladesh s foreign secretary  the top civil servant in the foreign ministry   the red cross confirmed that it had passed on the request to myanmar but said that it was a political decision for the two countries to make    a myanmar government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment   hundreds of thousands of rohingya have fled to bangladesh  a mostly muslim nation of  million  from buddhist majority myanmar in recent years   the decades old conflict in rakhine flared most recently on aug    when rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base  since then  an estimated   rohingya have fled to bangladesh  according to the u n  high commissioner for refugees  joining more than   others already living there in cramped makeshift camps since the early   there are widespread fears that tens of thousands more could try to cross if the violence doesn t abate  recent pictures from the border between the two countries show hundreds of rohingya men  women and children trying to cross over into bangladesh on foot and by boat  the humanitarian crisis next door has left bangladesh scrambling to deal with people that it does not welcome either   in recent days  bangladesh officials have said they plan to go ahead with a controversial plan to develop an isolated  flood prone island in the bay of bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of refugees  drawing fresh criticism from the international community  it bowed to pressure on thursday  with government officials saying that dhaka would now make another   acres   hectares  of land available for camps to house refugees near cox s bazar  where many refugees already live as it is near the border with myanmar    they will be given temporary shelter   said kazi abdur rahman  additional deputy commissioner of cox s bazar  but rahman added that the refugees would be fingerprinted and confined to the camp so that they did not mix with the local community   these measures  however  do not offer a long term solution to the crisis  and dhaka says it is getting little support from its neighbor  which has been accused of trying to engineer  ethnic cleansing within its borders   bangladesh officials said they had proposed joint patrolling along the border but did not receive a response from myanmar  earlier this week  bangladesh lodged a protest after it said myanmar had laid landmines near the border between the two countries  myanmar leader aung san suu kyi  a nobel laureate  has come under pressure to halt violence against rohingya   she has said that her government was doing its best to protect everyone in rakhine but did not refer specifically to the rohingya exodus   the solution lies in myanmar  the un hopes that myanmar can address the root causes of the problem   said shinji kubo  head of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in bangladesh   kubo said the bangladesh government was doing its best by accepting the refugees instead of sending them back  bangladesh officials are turning to the international community for help  claiming support from countries such as turkey  which has promised aid   on friday  a malaysian coast guard official said the country will not turn away rohingya muslims and is willing to provide them temporary shelter  but any such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months  because of the annual monsoon   the world community must come forward to help them  not by putting pressure on bangladesh but by putting pressure on myanmar not to resort to these atrocities and violence   said h t  imam  a senior aide to bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina    the only solution is to force myanmar to take back their citizens through international pressure  and we are working with our partners on that   imam said  besides the creation of internationally controlled safe zones in rakhine state  bangladesh has also mooted creating a buffer zone along the border  where the international community could set up camps and provide for the refugees  the officials said   further details of the plan could not be learned     we will give aid agencies access  but we are not interested to give them shelter here  we are already overburdened   said mostafa kamal uddin  bangladesh s home secretary  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News
shanghai  reuters    an old review of an academic monograph on agrarian revolutionaries in  china is hardly a political third rail in beijing today  even by the increasingly sensitive standards of the ruling communist party  that such a piece appeared on a list of some  scholarly works that cambridge university press  cup  said last week the chinese government had asked it to block from its website offers clues about the inner workings of china s vast and secretive censorship apparatus  say experts  president xi jinping has stepped up censorship and tightened controls on the internet and various aspects of civil society  as well as reasserting communist party authority over academia and other institutions  since coming to power in   far from being a well oiled machine  though  china s censorship regime is fragmented and often undermined by gaps  workarounds  and perhaps even hasty officials  say academics specializing in chinese politics   crude is the word   said jonathan sullivan  an associate professor at the university of nottingham in britain   the blunt way in which articles were chosen for censoring     suggest to me that there was not a lot of thought put into it   cup  the publishing arm of britain s elite cambridge university  on monday reversed its decision to comply with the request to censor the articles published in the journal china quarterly following an outcry over academic freedom  china s response remains to be seen  the education ministry  foreign ministry  cyberspace administration and state publishing authority all declined to comment  the list of articles the authorities wanted blocked covered topics that are considered sensitive by the government  including the  tiananmen square democracy protests  the   cultural revolution  tibet  taiwan and the violence prone far western region of xinjiang  but it was far from thorough or comprehensive  the article on  agrarian revolutionaries may have got there by mistake  say experts  what appears to have condemned the scathing but otherwise innocuous  review of kamal sheel s book about a communist base area in china s southern heartland was the fact the place was named xinjiang  and the word appeared in the book title  the chinese characters are different for xinjiang  the village  and xinjiang  the mostly muslim region more than   km    miles  to the northwest that is beset by ethnic tensions and occasional unrest  but in english they are indistinguishable  xu xibai  a doctoral candidate at the university of oxford  tweeted a brief analysis of the list that noted that its creators appear to have hastily searched the china quarterly database for taboo words in titles and abstracts   the censors probably used a few keyword searches to locate just enough articles to make a nice  long list to impress their superiors   xu s post said   they did not bother to read the articles or go through the content list manually   an article defending mao zedong was on the censored list  for instance  while others more critical of the former paramount leader were not  some sensitive subjects seem to have eluded the officials  net  the communist party tightly controls discourse on the   great leap forward  in which millions starved to death due to ill conceived economic policies  censors have banned books on the topic but it was apparently not on this list  nor were the brutal  communist led land reforms of the   or the hundred flowers movement  an effort by mao to lure critics out of the woodwork by feigning openness  only to punish them  the party s efforts to censor news and information have sometimes backfired or left outsiders perplexed  in   software designed to check pornographic and violent images on pcs blocked images of a movie poster for cartoon cat garfield  dishes of flesh color cooked pork and on one search engine a close up of film star johnny depp s face  citizen lab  a group of researchers based at the university of toronto  compiled a list of words banned as of last year on popular live streaming sites in china  among them   moulin rouge    braised rabbit    helicopter  and  zen   the request to block the articles was passed to cambridge university press by its import agent  but without knowing where it originated it is hard to draw firm conclusions  said sebastian veg  a china scholar at the school of advanced studies in social sciences in paris   the censorship system is of course centrally directed  but not uniform   veg said  lee siu yau  assistant professor of greater china studies at the education university of hong kong  suspects the request was a trial balloon   they usually start with something small scale and gradually expand and make their requirements more difficult   he said     this might be one of the first steps that the chinese government would take to see if it could actually influence international academic publishers    story refiles to add dropped words  a  and  an  in paragraphs four and six

beirut  reuters    u s  led warplanes on wednesday blocked a convoy of islamic state fighters and their families from reaching territory the group holds in eastern syria and struck some of their comrades traveling to meet them  a coalition spokesman said   the strikes were aimed at stopping an evacuation deal for islamic state fighters to leave their enclave on the lebanon syria border for areas they hold in eastern syria  arranged by the lebanese hezbollah group and the syrian army   it was part of a ceasefire agreed after offensives last week by the lebanese army on one front  and the syrian army and hezbollah on another  that pushed islamic state back into a small part of its enclave straddling the frontier  the deal has been criticized by the coalition and by iraq  whose army is also fighting islamic state in areas contiguous with the eastern syria region to which the convoy was headed    the convoy  carrying  militants and  civilians according to hezbollah  is now effectively stranded  unable to move forward into islamic state territory   it shows how easily such evacuations to other areas  which the government of syrian president bashar al assad has increasingly used to push rebel pockets to surrender  can be derailed in a conflict with many sides   a commander in the military alliance supporting assad said the coalition had contacted the syrian arab red crescent  which is accompanying the convoy and warned that if it entered islamic state territory  it might attack   islamic state is on the back foot in both syria and iraq  losing swathes of its territory and its most important towns and cities after taking advantage of chaos including the six year civil war in syria to win ground   in syria  the u s  led coalition is backing an alliance of kurdish and arab militias in the north which are assaulting the jihadist group s former de facto capital of raqqa  the russian backed syrian army and allied shi ite militia from iraq and lebanon including hezbollah have this year seized most of the central desert from the group  and are advancing eastwards to relieve the army s besieged enclave in deir al zor   the coalition strikes to block the convoy moving into islamic state territory took place east of humeima  near the edge of land held by the syrian government  coalition spokesman ryan dillon told reuters    we did crater the road and destroyed a small bridge to prevent this convoy from moving further east   dillon told reuters by phone  he later said the coalition had struck vehicles containing islamic state fighters that were heading to that area from deeper inside the territory they control to the east  he did not know if the evacuation convoy  which contains buses of fighters and their family members  as well as ambulances carrying wounded fighters  was now in islamic state or syrian government territory    on tuesday morning a hezbollah run military media unit reported the convoy had reached an exchange point into islamic state territory  the evacuation deal also involved islamic state revealing the fate of nine lebanese soldiers it took captive in its border enclave in   and surrendering hezbollah and syrian army prisoners and bodies in east syria  the commander in the pro assad military alliance said it was considering an alternative location for the convoy to cross into islamic state territory    now things are moving to change the place from humeima and head north towards sukhna   the commander said    we re not bound by these agreements   dillon said  apparently referring to the ceasefire deal   they re clearly fighters and they re moving to another location to fight yet again   in accordance with the law of armed conflict     we will strike them if we are able to do so   he said  adding that direct strikes on the convoy would only take place if the militants could be separated from civilians  brett mcgurk  the u s  envoy to the coalition  criticized the evacuation deal in a statement early on wednesday before the strikes were reported  saying   relocating terrorists from one place to another for someone else to deal with is not a lasting solution   separately  the leader of hezbollah  sayyed hassan nasrallah  defended the lebanese group s involvement in the evacuation deal in a statement responding to criticism of the move from iraqi prime minister haider al abadi  abadi said on tuesday   transporting this number of terrorists from long distance to eastern syria adjacent to iraqi borders is unacceptable   nasrallah said it was a hezbollah deal agreed upon by the syrian leadership  that the fighters were few in number  and were being moved from one front hezbollah was fighting in to another  lebanon is a major recipient of u s  and british military aid  it says its offensive against islamic state last week was separate to the simultaneous one made against the same pocket from inside syria by the syrian army and hezbollah  regarded by the u s  and britain as a terrorist group   on wednesday the lebanese army said its head general joseph aoun had been phoned by the commander of u s  central command joseph votel congratulating him on the offensive and pledging to continue arming lebanon s army   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

phnom penh  reuters    critics of cambodian prime minister hun sen have grown used to following upstart news service fresh news to find out what the government s next target might be  from treason accusations against detained opposition leader kem sokha to the tax demand against the now shuttered cambodia daily to allegations against the recently expelled u s  national democratic institute  it was on fresh news first  its rise  just as pressure is growing on more critical media  reflects a shift in control of information in the run up to next year s general election at the same time as a crackdown on hun sen s opponents   if any news needs to be reported  i may contact the prime minister or the prime minister may contact me    year old fresh news chief executive lim chea vutha told reuters  lim rejected accusations it publishes unsubstantiated reports to serve the government s interest and said it was just ambitious to break news the same as any major news agency  cambodia has long had one of southeast asia s most open media environments  but journalists with publications critical of the government say work is becoming tougher than during any period of hun sen s more than three decade rule   this means an imbalance of information   said pa nguon teang  head of the partly eu funded voice of democracy radio station  banned from broadcasting to its estimated   million listeners last month and now trying to publish via facebook  eighteen other radio stations were ordered off air while channels were also forbidden from rebroadcasting the u s  funded voice of america and radio free asia  the cambodia daily newspaper  whose editor described it as  a burr in hun sen s side  since it was started  years ago  was forced to close by a crippling    million tax bill   news of which first appeared on fresh news   the three year old publication also published the video that formed the basis for arresting opposition leader kem sokha for treason charges his lawyers dismiss as nonsense   it s not fresh news  it s not even fake news  it s bad news   bad news for the future of cambodia   said mu sochua  a deputy of kem sokha in his cambodia national rescue party  cambodia is not the only southeast asian country where the media is under pressure  with journalists and bloggers in thailand  the philippines  myanmar and vietnam facing everything from verbal threats to arrest to violence  hun sen has said his attitude to media he does not like is no different to that of u s  president donald trump  who has branded some liberal u s  news organizations  fake news  and has refused to take questions from their reporters  for hun sen  a  year old former khmer rouge soldier  critical media are  like children challenging their father   said huy vannak  president of the partly state funded union of journalist federations of cambodia   they only mock his good faith to the nation  that s why he s not tolerant   he said  praised openly by hun sen  fresh news now has more than  employees  at the company s ninth floor offices near a busy phnom penh junction  signs tell journalists  the first enemy of success is laziness   facebook is one of the main channels for fresh news to publish and has also been embraced by hun sen since the opposition almost won the  election  partly with the help of their social media strategy  while declining to give company financial details  lim said he received no money from the government  a government spokesman said there was no funding for fresh news or anyone publishing on social media beyond official accounts   lim said he was supported only by advertising  flipping through his mobile phone  he showed ads for everything from range rover to coca cola to local businesses thriving in an economy growing at around  percent a year  but business and government are entwined in cambodia and the leadership and its family members control many of cambodia s biggest enterprises   including media businesses  hun sen s oldest daughter  hun mana  chairs kampuchea thmey daily and bayon tv and radio among at least a dozen other firms  senate president and the deputy leader of the ruling cambodia people s party  say chhum  owns rasmei kampuchea  cambodia s most popular newspaper  according to a  study  media organizations with politically affiliated owners accounted for  percent of print readership and  percent of television viewership  of those owners  eight out of  were close to the ruling party  businesses won t give advertising to media seen as pro opposition because it won t help them  said huy vannak   the government doesn t need to sponsor you when your content is positive  business will come to you   he said  despite international awards for its reporting  the cambodia daily was not a big commercial success  by the end  it said it was barely breaking even and had no hope of paying a tax bill it disputed before the sept   deadline set by government  the paper appeared to get limited sympathy from lim   it s the right of the government to shut it down   he said   as we reported  it s a legal matter   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A

london  reuters    brexit minister david davis called on parliament on thursday to back legislation to sever britain s political  financial and legal ties with the european union  saying that opposing the bill would lead to chaos  at a rowdy session of parliament  davis accused the opposition labour party of pursuing a  cynical and unprincipled  path by challenging the repeal bill  or eu withdrawal bill  designed to disentangle britain from more than  years of eu lawmaking  labour  in turn  said the government was using the bill to give itself wide ranging powers and a  blank cheque  to do away with laws if ministers did not like them  threatening the rights of ordinary britons  the legislation is a vital stepping stone towards britain s departure from the eu in march   it faces stormy debate and a likely barrage of attempted amendments as prime minister theresa may  weakened by the loss of her majority in a june election and criticized by brussels over her brexit strategy  attempts to steer it through parliament   without this legislation a smooth and orderly exit is impossible     to delay or oppose the bill will be reckless in the extreme   davis told lawmakers  describing support for a proposed amendment by labour as a  vote for a chaotic exit   labour s brexit spokesman  keir starmer  said several clauses in the bill amounted to a  power grab  by government  he said it would prevent britain from remaining in the eu s single market and customs union during a transition phase  as labour now argues should happen   that we are leaving  the eu  is settled  how we leave is not  this bill invites us to surrender all power and influence over that question to the government and to ministers  that would betray everything we have been sent here to do   starmer said   unless the government makes a very significant concession before we vote on monday labour will table  and has tabled  a reasoned amendment and will vote against the bill       the legislation seeks largely to  copy and paste  eu law into british legislation to ensure the uk has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of leaving it  something that may offer some reassurance for companies  davis said it would allow the british government and parliament to become  masters of our own laws   and promised concerned lawmakers that ministers would not use the wide ranging powers to make  substantive changes  to law  to vote down the bill  labour would need to convince eu supporters in may s conservatives to side with them  but some more vocal pro eu conservative lawmakers have now said they will vote with the government after asking for reassurance that parliament will be able to scrutinize any changes to the law  may has also promised to listen to the concerns of lawmakers  but warned that delaying or hindering the bill with amendments would slow  vital  legislation   the repeal bill helps deliver the outcome the british people voted for by ending the role of the eu in uk law  but it s also the single most important step we can take to prevent a cliff edge for people and businesses  because it provides legal certainty   she said in a statement  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

cox s bazar  bangladesh yangon  reuters    two blasts rocked an area on the myanmar side of the border with bangladesh on monday  accompanied by the sound of gunfire and thick black smoke  as violence that has sent nearly   muslim rohingya fleeing to bangladesh showed no sign of easing  bangladeshi border guards said a woman lost a leg from a blast about  meters inside myanmar and was carried into bangladesh to get treatment  reuters reporters heard explosions and saw black smoke rising near a myanmar village  the latest violence in myanmar s northwestern rakhine state began on aug    when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base  the ensuing clashes and a military counter offensive have killed at least  people and triggered the exodus of villagers to bangladesh  a rohingya refugee who went to the site of the blast   on a footpath near where civilians fleeing violence are huddled in no man s land on the border   filmed what appeared to be a mine  a metal disc about  centimeters    inches  in diameter partially buried in the mud  he said he believed there were two more such devices buried in the ground  bangladeshi border guards said they believed the injured woman stepped on an anti personnel mine  although that was not confirmed  two refugees also told reuters they saw members of the myanmar army around the site in the immediate period preceding the blasts which occurred around   p m   reuters was unable to independently verify that the planted devices were landmines and that there was any link to the myanmar army  the spokesman for myanmar s national leader aung san suu kyi  zaw htay  said that a clarification was needed to determine  where did it explode  who can go there and who laid those land mines  who can surely say those mines were not laid by the terrorists    there are so many questions  i would like to say that it is not solid news writing if you write based on someone talking nonsense on the side of the road   said zaw htay  the treatment of buddhist majority myanmar s roughly   million muslim rohingya is the biggest challenge facing suu kyi  accused by western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution  the nobel peace prize laureate has come under increasing diplomatic pressure from countries with large muslim populations such as turkey and

burning of homes and civilian deaths but rights monitors and rohingya fleeing to neighboring bangladesh say the myanmar army is trying to force rohingya out with a campaign of arson and killings  the number of those crossing the border into bangladesh       surpassed the number who escaped myanmar after a series of much smaller insurgent attacks last october that set off a military operation  that operation has led to accusations of serious human rights abuses  the newest estimate  based on calculations by u n  workers in the bangladeshi border district of cox s bazar  takes to about   the total number of rohingya who have sought refuge in bangladesh since october  the new arrivals have strained aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands of refugees from previous

ago   no non government organizations came here  we have no food  some women gave birth on the roadside  sick children have no treatment    hundreds of rohingya milled beside the road while others

seoul  reuters    decorated by pyongyang but blacklisted abroad  two scientists pictured with north korea s leader ahead of sunday s nuclear test play vital roles in the reclusive country s pursuit of a powerful weapon capable of striking the united states  experts say  north korea s sixth nuclear test on sunday showed the country has either developed a hydrogen bomb   which has vastly more destructive power than atomic bombs   or was very getting close to obtaining one  photos released by the official kcna news agency just hours before the test showed two men standing alongside leader kim jong un as he inspected a new peanut shaped warhead  ri hong sop  head of north korea s nuclear weapons institute  and hong sung mu  deputy director of the ruling workers  party of korea s munitions industry department  several north korea leadership experts say they are part of a cadre of weapons experts at the frontline of the young leader s stated ambition  developing an intercontinental ballistic missile  icbm  that can carry a nuclear weapon to the united states  compared to his father kim jong il and grandfather kim il sung who preferred small working groups and middle managers to deal with weapons programs  the  year old leader has been more personally involved with these scientists  the experts say  citing his frequent appearances with the technocrats at state events  weapons tests and field inspections   it appears that hong is spearheading the nuclear development program as a senior party official and ri is in charge of nuclear tests such as hydrogen bombs on a working level   said yang moo jin  professor at the university of north korean studies in seoul  who monitors the country s hierarchy and leadership  reuters could not independently confirm the precise role of the two men  the north korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in pyongyang for comment by email  fax or phone  the north korean mission to the united nations was not immediately available for comment  the two scientists have become increasingly high profile as pyongyang s weapons programs have advanced at a rapid pace under kim s leadership  a reuters review of north korean state media showed      in january   hong and ri were the first and second in line to receive medals personally awarded by kim at a ceremony to mark the country s fourth nuclear test  state tv footage showed  two months later  they accompanied a smiling kim inspecting a silver colored sphere  which the north said was a miniaturized warhead capable of being fitted to an icbm    the wider group of weapons technocrats includes a trio of rocket scientists who have accompanied kim on several crucial missile launches  including two july icbm test launches that showed much of the u s  mainland was now within range     experts say kim s hands on approach may have contributed to faster development of its nuclear weapons and missiles  while allowing the scientists to develop personal links to the leader    kim  jong un goes out of his way to show they have a personal closeness to him   said michael madden  an expert on the north korean leadership  pointing to kim s frequent appearances with cadres engaged with its weapons program    it s likely linked to the fact that  the scientists  are making huge accomplishments in this area  and thus making big accomplishments for kim jong un as leader of north korea   like the three rocket scientists  ri and hong have been blacklisted in recent years by the united nations  the united states or south korea for their roles in north korea s weapons programs  the united nations blacklisted ri in  citing his involvement  in the production of weapons grade plutonium   while an expert un panel this year noted hong s  key role in the country s nuclear program  as it recommended he also be sanctioned    ri is a former director of yongbyon nuclear research centre  north korea s main nuclear facility north of pyongyang  yongbyon operates the country s first nuclear reactors and its only confirmed uranium enrichment facility  siegfried hecker  a nuclear science professor at stanford university and one of the last americans to visit yongbyon  recalled meeting ri during his several visits there between  and   in one of these visits  ri showed hecker around the plutonium reactor and the radiochemical lab there  ri  stated with pride  that north korea s nuclear researchers have mastered plutonium production with no outside help  hecker said in a  report about his yongbyon visit to standford s center for international security and cooperation  hecker did not immediately respond to requests for comment about ri or the north korean nuclear program  in a statement carried by kcna hours before the sixth test  kim said all components of the hydrogen bomb were  homemade   allowing north korea to produce nuclear weapons  as many as it wants   hong is a former chief engineer at yongbyon and has been at the ruling party s munitions department since the mid   he rose to prominence after kim jong un took power in december  following the death of his father

berlin  reuters    near the end of a recent campaign speech in northern germany  chancellor angela merkel turned to europe s refugee crisis of  and offered her audience a comforting dual message  germans should be proud of the warm welcome they gave  hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers  many of them fleeing war and persecution in the middle east  she told an audience of over   gathered in the fishing village of steinhude   then she shifted gears   what happened in  cannot  should not and must not happen again    it is a phrase she has used repeatedly in market squares across germany as she campaigns for a fourth term in a federal election on sept   that she is widely expected to win    two years since she opened germany s borders to asylum seekers to avert what she says was a looming humanitarian disaster  and saw her popularity slide as a result  merkel has climbed her way out of the deepest hole of her political career   there are many factors behind her comeback  but few are as important as her skill at spinning a narrative about the refugee crisis that many germans can support  whether they cheered or condemned her actions of    merkel is not running on a policy of open borders and that fits perfectly with the mood in the country   said robin alexander  author of a best selling book on the german government s handling of the refugee crisis   many people like the image of germany as a model of humanitarian virtue  at the same time they know the country could not continue to welcome refugees like it did  it is this set of feelings that merkel is appealing to   by the end of     asylum seekers had entered germany  many without proper identity checks  overwhelming local communities  merkel s actions divided europe and led to a surge in anti immigrant sentiment  the hard right alternative for germany  afd  party seems sure to enter parliament for the first time  a year after her decision  and following a series of small scale attacks in germany by islamist militants  her popularity ratings had plunged  points to  percent and she faced questions about whether she would run for chancellor again   yet today   percent of germans say she is doing a good job and  according to a bertelsmann foundation survey this week   percent believe the country is on the right track   it has been a long  difficult road back   said one of her top aides   but we have gotten to a point where the refugee issue is no longer a negative for merkel in the election campaign   merkel has been helped by external events such as britain s vote for brexit last year and donald trump s election victory in the  u s  presidential election  both of which reinforced her appeal as a guarantor of stability   a decision by macedonia in early  to shut its border with greece stemmed the flow of refugees  easing pressure on germany  and the country has not suffered a large scale islamist attack  an event which might have triggered a voter backlash  but merkel s knack for understanding how germans tick has also been crucial   at many of her public appearances  she is confronted by anti immigration protesters who try to drown out her speeches with whistles and chants of  merkel must go     in steinhude  a woman held up a sign showing merkel s diamond shaped hand pose over a german flag with a blood spattered bullet hole in the middle   i offer you terror  death and chaos   the sign read  but the dozen or so protesters were dwarfed by supporters who applauded her message   i m not sure if there was another way to handle the refugee crisis  those refugees had to go somewhere   said willi kordes    who runs a sewage treatment firm in nearby vlotho   i don t trust anyone to do it better   working in her favor in the election is the fact that many of germany s other established parties  including the centre left social democrats  spd   led by her main challenger martin schulz  backed her open door policy  the afd  running a racially tinged campaign that has put off some voters  has come off its  highs in the polls  the one mainstream party that has offered a hardline alternative  the christian social union  csu   is the bavarian sister party to merkel s christian democratic union  cdu   a vote for the csu is akin to a vote for merkel  a crucial factor behind merkel s rebound has been the decline in asylum seekers entering germany  about   arrived in   with another drop likely this year  merkel takes credit for this  pointing to a deal she brokered between the european union and turkey  under which ankara has cut the number of migrants crossing into europe via its territory    but critics say the closing of balkan borders   which merkel publicly opposed   was the real driver  some see parallels with her behavior in the euro zone financial crisis  when european central bank president mario draghi s pledge to do  whatever it takes  to keep the currency bloc together  allowing her to stick to a hard line towards euro states such as greece without fear of consequences   in the refugee crisis  it has been countries like macedonia  turkey and hungary   which shut down routes the refugees used   that have done merkel s  dirty work   allowing her to maintain the image of a caring leader who helped people fleeing war  the approach has helped merkel extend her control over the political centre  some right wing voters may have fled for the afd but polls suggest young  urban voters who traditionally lean left could fill the gap   germany s economy has been strong enough to absorb the influx of refugees without big cracks emerging in society  in reaction to its nazi past  germany has emerged as a more open  tolerant country than many assumed when the crisis hit  a survey published this month ranking the top fears of the germans put terrorism at the top  but a separate poll for the bild newspaper showed they do not see curbing immigration as a priority   germans are astonishingly global  liberal and open to the world   said menno smid  head of the infas institute for applied social sciences  which released a survey last month showing broad acceptance of refugees in germany   we are the winners from globalization  the economic factors that led to trump simply don t exist   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

seoul  reuters    the billionaire head of south korea s samsung group  jay y  lee  was sentenced to five years in jail for bribery on friday in a watershed for the country s decades long economic order dominated by powerful  family run conglomerates  after a six month trial over a scandal that brought down the then president  park geun hye  a court ruled that lee had paid bribes in anticipation of favours from park  the court also found lee guilty of hiding assets abroad  embezzlement and perjury  lee  the  year old heir to one of the world s biggest corporate empires  has been held since february on charges that he bribed park to help secure control of a conglomerate that owns samsung electronics  the world s leading smartphone and chip maker  and has interests ranging from drugs and home appliances to insurance and hotels   lee  who emerged stony faced from the seoul courtroom in a dark suit  but without a tie  and holding a document envelope  was escorted by justice ministry officials back to his detention centre    this case is a matter of lee jae yong and samsung group executives  who had been steadily preparing for lee s succession     bribing the president   seoul central district court judge kim jin dong said  using lee s korean name  kim said that as the group s heir apparent  lee  stood to benefit the most  from any political favours for samsung  lee denied wrongdoing  and one of his lawyers  song wu cheol  said he would appeal   the entire guilty verdict is unacceptable   song said  adding he was confident his client s innocence would be affirmed by a higher court  the case is expected to be appealed all the way up to the supreme court  likely next year    the five year sentence   one of the longest given to a south korean business leader   is a landmark for south korea  where the family run conglomerates   or chaebols   have long been revered for helping transform the once war ravaged country into a global economic powerhouse  but they have more recently been criticized for holding back the economy and stifling small businesses and start ups  samsung  a symbol of the country s rise from poverty following the   korean war  has come to epitomize the cosy and sometimes corrupt ties between politicians and the chaebols   the ruling is a turning point for chaebols   said chang sea jin  a business professor at korea advanced institute of science and technology   in the past  chaebols weren t afraid of laws because they were lenient  now  lee s ruling sets a precedent for strict enforcement of laws  and chaebols should be wary   under south korean law  sentences of more than three years cannot be suspended  the third generation de facto head of the powerful samsung group  lee has effectively directed operations since his father  lee kun hee  was incapacitated by a heart attack in      some investors worry a prolonged leadership vacuum could slow decision making at the group  which has more than five dozen affiliate companies and assets of   trillion won     billion   its listed companies make up about  percent of the market value of south korea s kospi stock index  many tycoons  including lee s father  were convicted of crimes in the past  ranging from bribery  embezzlement and tax evasion  only to get presidential pardons  as both the government and the public feared going too hard on them would hurt the economy  but south korea s new liberal president  moon jae in  who won a may election  has pledged to rein in the chaebols  empower minority shareholders and end the practice of pardoning tycoons convicted of white collar crime  the presidential blue house said in a statement that it hopes the ruling will serve as an opportunity to  end the nexus of business and politics that has held back the country   in a june interview with reuters  moon said he did not believe samsung s operations depended just on lee    when lee was taken into custody  the share prices of samsung went up   moon said   if we were to succeed in reforming the running of the chaebols and also increasing transparency  i believe this will not only help the economic power of korea but also help to make the chaebols themselves more competitive   investors say shares in chaebol companies trade at lower prices than they would otherwise because of their opaque corporate governance   the so called korea discount  shares of samsung electronics dropped more than  percent  and other group companies  including samsung c t and samsung sds  also turned lower after the verdict  the court said samsung s financial support of entities backed by a friend of park s  choi soon sil  constituted bribery  including   billion won     million  in sponsoring the equestrian career of choi s daughter  in return  prosecutors say  samsung sought government support for the  merger of two of its affiliates  which helped lee tighten control of the conglomerate  his lawyers had argued that the merger was done for business reasons  some criminal lawyers had expected lee to be found innocent of the major charges  as much of the evidence at the trial has been circumstantial  the appeals court and the supreme court might put a greater emphasis on prosecutors to provide direct proof of quid pro quo  the lawyers said  park  who was forced from office in march  faces her own corruption trial  with a ruling expected later this year  prosecutors have argued that park and lee took part in the same act of bribery   so lee s conviction would appear ominous  for the former president   hundreds of park s diehard supporters who rallied outside the court on friday reacted with outrage to the ruling   our ultimate goal is park s acquittal and release   kim won joon  a  year old former construction worker said   we worry how today s guilty verdict for lee would affect park s ruling   such supporters are a minority compared with the huge crowds that turned out in seoul every week to call for park s ouster after the bribery scandal surfaced late last year  public approval of lee s prosecution may underscore growing frustration in asia s fourth largest economy that the wealth amassed by conglomerates has not trickled down   i think it was difficult for a court to ignore public opinion  given that the scandal rocked the country   said chung sun sup  chief executive of research firm chaebul com   the five year sentence was low given that he was found guilty of all the charges  i think the court gave him a lighter sentence  taking into account samsung s importance to the economy

caracas  reuters    venezuela s opposition is shifting its focus to forthcoming state elections as protests aimed at ousting president nicolas maduro have subsided following the installation of an all powerful  pro government legislative body  four months of violent demonstrations in which at least  people were killed have all but stopped due to fatigue among protesters and disillusionment at seeing the ruling socialist party cement vast powers despite the concerted opposition push   most opposition leaders say october s elections for governors in all the country s  states now represent the best means to keep pressuring maduro  providing a chance to win some of the governorships at stake and an opportunity for a protest vote to demonstrate the president s unpopularity  the opposition  which boycotted the elections for the constituent assembly  accused electoral authorities of inflating turn out figures for the july  vote  there are few options available for adversaries of maduro  who maintains control over the opec nation despite widespread public anger about triple digit inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods   venezuelans are fighting against a continued rupture of the constitutional order   said opposition leader henrique capriles  who is governor of miranda state but who is not running in next month s election and who is barred from holding public office once his term expires  nevertheless he urged venezuelans to vote in the elections   if you abstain  then it s more difficult to bring about the political change that all venezuelans want   capriles told reporters  capriles has called his own barring from office   because of alleged irregularities in managing public funds   a socialist party move to sideline him  governorships provide little in the way of a platform to directly challenge maduro  but they are coveted by politicians because they offer launching pads for political careers and the possibility to channel state resources toward political allies   the opposition s participation in next month s poll ensures it will have witnesses at voting stations and at the election council headquarters  opposition coalition leaders say that should allow them to quickly identify any attempt to alter results  however  some who spent months on the streets with the encouragement of opposition leaders  especially young members of a self styled  resistance  movement  feel betrayed  they say turning attention so quickly to the election legitimizes what they view as maduro s authoritarianism and insults the memory of slain protesters  they also see a contradiction with the opposition s decision to boycott july s  vote for the constituent assembly  maduro pushed for the creation of the assembly  which is meant to rewrite the constitution but which has no formal check on its powers  saying it would restore stability to a country in turmoil over the widespread anti government protests   it has broadly supplanted the congress  which the opposition won control of in a  landslide vote  small opposition party vente venezuela and its founder maria corina machado  who has a high profile in the media but limited influence  broke with the opposition s democratic unity coalition over its decision to join next month s vote   the main opposition parties have nominated candidates and opinion polls show that in a free and fair vote they would likely take a majority  compared to just three governorships they won in   but the socialist party controlled constituent assembly may bar some of them from running or from holding office if they win   last week  the assembly said it would seek the prosecution of opposition leaders for treason for attempting to block international financing for maduro s government and for allegedly seeking a military intervention against him  government leaders say the end of the protests is evidence the constituent assembly has brought peace to the country  they add that the opposition s decision to register candidates is a sign they believe in the electoral system despite their complaints of fraud   the constituent assembly has calmed the country   said assembly president delcy rodriguez   as soon as it was inaugurated  venezuela returned to tranquility    maduro says the country is a victim of an  economic war  by the opposition  and insists the assembly is a symbol of venezuela s vibrant democracy  the opposition took to the streets in late march to protest a supreme court ruling that briefly allowed it to assume the powers of congress  and maintained near daily rallies until the end of july  by then  street mobilizations were in decline and what had initially been massive marches steadily gave way to violent clashes between security forces and small groups of hooded demonstrators throwing rocks and at times vandalizing property  recent opposition rallies have attracted only a few hundred people  u s  president donald trump has imposed sanctions on top ruling socialist party officials  in some cases for their participation in the constituent assembly  while the european union and most latin american nations condemned the body  maduro has acquired the reputation as a dictator around the world  said opposition leader freddy guevara in an interview in august broadcast on the internet  adding that street protests were crucial in shifting public opinion   i m convinced that we have to confront the dictatorship in any situation that we can   said guevara   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not

million votes  kenyatta s ruling party also swept the legislature  those results triggered angry protests and at least  people died in the police clamp down that followed    for the first time in history of african democratization a ruling has been made by a court nullifying irregular elections for the president   odinga said outside the court   later  he called for the commission to resign

yangon  reuters    muslim militants in myanmar staged a coordinated attack on  police posts and an army base in rakhine state on friday  and at least  of the insurgents and  members of the security forces were killed  the army and government said  the fighting   still going on in some areas   marked a major escalation in a simmering conflict in the northwestern state since last october  when similar attacks prompted a big military sweep beset by allegations of serious human rights abuses  the arakan rohingya salvation army  arsa   a group previously known as harakah al yaqin  which instigated the october attacks  claimed responsibility for the early morning offensive  and warned of more  the treatment of approximately   million muslim rohingya has emerged as majority buddhist myanmar s most contentious human rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule  it now appears to have spawned a potent insurgency which has grown in size  observers say   they worry that the attacks   much larger and better organized than those in october   will spark an even more aggressive army response and trigger communal clashes between muslims and buddhist ethnic rakhines  a news team affiliated with the office of national leader  aung san suu kyi  said that one soldier  one immigration officer   policemen and  insurgents had been killed in the fighting   in the early morning at  a m   the extremist bengali insurgents started their attack on the police post     with the man made bombs and small weapons   said the army in a separate statement  referring to the rohingya by a derogatory term implying they are interlopers from bangladesh  the militants also used sticks and swords and destroyed bridges with explosives  the army said  the rohingya are denied citizenship and are seen by many in myanmar as illegal immigrants from bangladesh  despite claiming roots in the region that go back centuries  with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence  the military counter offensive in october resulted in some   rohingya fleeing to bangladesh  where they joined many others who have fled from myanmar over the past  years  the united nations said myanmar s security forces likely committed crimes against humanity in the offensive that began in october  on friday  the united nations condemned the militant attacks and called for all parties to refrain from violence  the united states also condemned the attacks on security forces and it warned the government against indiscriminate reprisals   as government and security forces act to prevent further violence and bring those responsible for the attacks to justice  we expect them to do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of law  protects and respects human rights and fundamental freedoms  demonstrates transparency  and avoids inflaming a tense situation   the u s  state department said in a statement      the military said about  rohingya attacked an army base in taung bazar village in buthidaung township  among the police posts attacked was a station in the majority rakhine village of kyauk pandu   km   miles  south of the major town of maungdaw  police officer kyaw win tun said the insurgents burned down the post and police had been called to gather at a main station  residents were fearful as darkness approached   we heard that a lot of muslim villagers are grouping together  they will make more attacks on us when the sun goes down   said maung maung chay  a rakhine villager from the hamlet  the attack took place hours after a panel led by the former u n  chief kofi annan advised the government on long term solutions for the violence riven state  annan condemned the violence on friday  saying  no cause can justify such brutality and senseless killing   military sources told reuters they estimated    insurgents took part in the offensive and it encompassed both maungdaw and buthidaung townships   a much wider area compared with october  the leader of arsa  ata ullah  has said hundreds of young rohingya have joined the group  which says it is waging a legitimate defence against the army and for human rights   we have been taking our defensive actions against the burmese marauding forces in more than  different places across the region  more soon   the group said on twitter  chris lewa of the rohingya monitoring group  the arakan project  said a major concern was what happened to some  rohingya villagers trapped inside their section of zay di pyin village which had been surrounded by rakhine vigilantes armed with sticks and swords    we are running for our lives   said one of the zay di pyin s rohingya villagers reached by telephone  adding that houses had been set on fire  the government said the village had been burned down but blamed the fire on the rohingya  amid rising tension over the past few weeks  more than   new refugees have fled to bangladesh  where border guards on friday pushed back  people trying to flee the violence  mohammed shafi  who lives in a rohingya refugee camp in bangladesh  said his cousin in myanmar had told him of the trouble   the military is everywhere  people are

new delhi  reuters    india has been investigating how bloomberg philanthropies  founded by billionaire michael bloomberg  funds local non profit groups for anti tobacco lobbying  government documents show  making it the latest foreign non government organization to come under scrutiny  prime minister narendra modi s government has since  tightened surveillance of non profit groups  saying they were acting against india s national interests  thousands of foreign funded charities  licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations  critics  however  say the government has used the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of india s rapid economic development   the intelligence wing of india s home ministry last year drafted a note on bloomberg philanthropies  raising concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to  target  indian tobacco businesses and  aggressively  lobby against the sector  though the three page note  reviewed by reuters  said the bloomberg initiative s  claimed intention to free india of tobacco cannot be faulted  given the known risks from tobacco  it highlighted the sector s importance  noting it brings in nearly   billion in annual revenue for governments  and provides a livelihood for millions of people   foreign interests making foreign contributions     for purposes of lobbying against an established economic activity raises multiple concerns   the note said  including  it said  an  adverse economic impact  on  million people  the june    note  marked  secret  and circulated to top government officials  including in modi s office  has not previously been reported  the probe continued until at least april this year  another government document showed  rebecca carriero  a spokeswoman for michael bloomberg and new york based bloomberg philanthropies  declined to comment as they were unaware of any investigation  a home ministry spokesman said  queries which relate to security agencies cannot be answered   modi s office did not respond to an email seeking comment  the ministry s note was one of the factors behind the rejection of a foreign funding license renewal of at least one bloomberg funded india charity last october  said a senior government official aware of the investigation  michael bloomberg  one of the world s richest people and a former new york city mayor  has committed nearly   billion to support global tobacco control efforts  one of his focus countries is india  where tobacco kills   people a year  other than funding indian ngos  bloomberg s charity has in the past worked on improving road safety and supported federal tobacco control efforts  in   modi called michael bloomberg a  friend   and the two agreed on working together on india s ambitious plan to build so called smart cities  the home ministry note said the bloomberg charity successfully lobbied for the introduction of bigger health warnings on cigarette packs   contrary  to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel  while the panel called for the size of warnings to be more than doubled to  percent of a pack s surface area  the health ministry sought a higher figure of  percent  despite protests from india s   billion cigarette industry  the supreme court last year ordered manufacturers to follow the more stringent health ministry rules  that  the note said  was the first of the three phase bloomberg campaign targeting india s tobacco industry  it did not explain how exactly the bloomberg charity lobbied  while the note mirrored some of india s tobacco lobby s positions   such as how anti smoking policies could adversely impact farmers   the government official said the investigation was not done at the behest of the industry   anti tobacco lobby wants to kill revenue generating activities   the official said  a health ministry official  however  said   we don t see tobacco as an economic activity   he added that the health ministry was unaware of the home ministry s note on bloomberg philanthropies  india has stepped up scrutiny of ngos registered under the foreign contribution regulation act  fcra   in   the home ministry put the ford foundation on a watch list and suspended greenpeace india s fcra license  drawing criticism from the united states  earlier this year  the government banned foreign funding for the public health foundation of india  a group backed by the bill   melinda gates foundation  saying it used foreign donations to  lobby  for tobacco control policy issues   which is prohibited under fcra       in the bloomberg case  the home ministry note included a chart showing how funds flowed from bloomberg philanthropies to its partner  the campaign for tobacco free kids  which was then funding five local fcra registered ngos  these ngos  the note said  were being used by the bloomberg charity for  anti tobacco lobbying activities   the fcra license of at least one of them   the institute of public health  iph  bengaluru   was not renewed in october  in part due to the home ministry s note  the government official said  the iph said it was told by the home ministry that its license was not being renewed on the basis of a  field agency report   but no details were given  it was unaware of the investigation on bloomberg philanthropies  in april  the home ministry wrote to the federal health ministry  citing an  inquiry into foreign funding  for lobbying to change laws in india  the letter  seen by reuters  mentioned the bloomberg initiative and directed the health ministry to report on anti tobacco lobbying by foreign donors in other countries where tobacco is widely used  the health ministry has not yet sent that report  another government official said  the

 reuters    hurricane irma will pose the toughest test yet for u s  nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan in   irma was on course to hit south florida early on sunday after slamming cuba as a category  storm  it weakened to a category  storm with maximum sustained winds of  miles per hour   km per hour  on saturday  but was expected to strengthen before reaching florida  bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors  the national hurricane center s forecast track shows irma making landfall on the southwest side of the florida peninsula  west of the two nuclear reactors at the turkey point plant   the operator  florida power   light  fpl   has said it will shut turkey point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant  the reactors are about  miles   kilometers  south of miami  fpl said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in florida at st lucie  which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state s east coast  about  miles   km  north of miami   we will shut the reactors down  hours before category  force winds are forecast to hit   fpl chief executive eric silagy told a news conference  fpl said both turkey point and st lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated  feet   meters  above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges  but south miami mayor philip stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at turkey point  which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool  at fukushima in japan  an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown    the whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind  the real problem from my perspective is water   stoddard said  he said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors   the real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool   peter robbins  an fpl spokesman  said  mayor stoddard is wrong  turkey point is safe and is ready for hurricane irma   u s  nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since fukushima  the u s  nuclear regulatory commission  nrc  required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost  nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems   things are better today than in march   time will tell whether better proves good enough   said dave lochbaum  director of a watchdog group  the nuclear safety project  at the union of concerned scientists  the nrc said it was posting more inspectors at the two florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in georgia and south carolina should the storm head that way  the nrc said the plants should not be compromised by irma s storm surge   the storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites  designs   said nrc spokesman scott burnell  both florida plants have previously weathered major storms  turkey point took a hit from hurricane andrew  a category  storm  in   damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site  repairs cost about   million  st lucie withstood the back to back impact of hurricanes frances  category   and jeanne  category   in   fpl shut st lucie last october as hurricane matthew skirted the florida coast  lochbaum said the nrc and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding  in january   about   gallons of rainwater leaked into the st lucie plant after a heavy downpour  an nrc study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after fukushima  there is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in florida which stopped operating in   that is the crystal river plant  owned by duke energy corp  duk n   duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant  once in storage  the fuel no longer needs cooling   the nrc s burnell said duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of irma  he said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power  even though it has been shut for years  irma is expected to disrupt much of florida s power supply  fpl  the state s largest electric company  has warned irma could cut service to about   million of its nearly  million customers  fpl is one of four large publicly traded utilities in florida  other natural disasters since fukushima have shut some plants  an earthquake in virginia in  shut dominion energy inc s  d n  north anna plant for about    months  the time it took to complete a full damage inspection  that plant

humiliation   in recent months  most of lebanon s main parties have united in pushing for repatriation  a difficult demand as war has ravaged much of syria  rights groups have warned against forced return  and refugees often say they fear conscription into the syrian army  calls for refugees to return come as the syrian government shores up its rule over the main urban centers and ceasefire deals have eased fighting with rebels in parts of western syria   the united nations refugee agency has not seen a growing trend of reported attacks against syrians  but has voiced concern about mounting tensions  reports of attacks remain isolated incidents  spokeswoman lisa abou khaled said  but refugees do  feel more anxious  and afraid    tensions escalated in june after lebanon s army arrested hundreds of syrians in a raid on refugee camps near the border  during which suicide bombers attacked soldiers   when four detainees later died in custody  the military said it was from chronic illness  activists and refugees challenged this account  some blaming the deaths on torture   in this climate  a video circulated widely on social media of three lebanese men beating up a refugee on the street  authorities detained the attackers  syrians in lebanon say they have faced widespread harassment  some of those reuters interviewed said they felt it deteriorate in recent weeks  but others described it as just part of their daily existence as refugees    i don t dare walk down the street   said one refugee living amid makeshift tents in the akkar region  who declined to be named because of security fears   i get swear words   abu yazan  who came to lebanon five years ago  said many people had since extended sympathy to his family  but hostility from strangers and the recent assault scarred him  the attackers threatened to shoot him if they saw him again    we hear a lot of talk   you syrians have robbed us  go back to your country   he said   when we came to lebanon  it wasn t by choice  we were fleeing a war  we considered them our people  our brothers   many lebanese worry refugees threaten the country s security and burden its sluggish economy  which has been hard hit by syria s war  others say refugees take jobs or strain lebanon s already dysfunctional public services  the lebanese government has long avoided setting up official refugee camps  so  many syrians live in tented settlements  languishing in poverty and facing restrictions on legal residence or work   during a mass last month  the head of lebanon s maronite christian church  patriarch beshara al rai  urged politicians to work on returning syrians to their own country   the patriarch accused refugees of  snatching  the lebanese people s  daily bread from their mouths  throwing them into a state of poverty and deprivation   nasser yassin  a researcher of refugee policy at the american university of beirut  said lebanese communities were growing weary of hosting large numbers of refugees   while resentment existed before   things have changed drastically in the last couple of weeks     mostly fueled by politicians and other leaders   he said   yassin warned against politicians fanning the flames by inflating the actual burden of the refugee crisis    imagine that things go out of control  that s a recipe for civil war   he said  it is an ominous warning in a country whose own  year war involved palestinian refugees   politicians fret that any long term presence of mainly sunni syrian refugees could destabilize lebanon by shifting its delicate sectarian balance       syria s conflict has inflamed political rivalries and sectarian divisions that have far from healed since lebanon s   war   the united nations  security forces  and local officials have all mobilized to ease tensions  said ziad el sayegh  senior national policy adviser for lebanon s ministry of displaced  rights groups and activists have criticized lebanon for ignoring the crisis in its early years with no national policy to handle the influx of people  the ministry was now developing a policy to coordinate the work of state agencies  he said    the socio economic strains have crossed the limit   sayegh added   all of lebanon wants returns  there is no dispute over that    syrians should go back with the help of the united nations under the right safety guarantees  he said   an issue that has deeply divided lebanon s political blocs   shi ite hezbollah and its allies  who side with syrian president bashar al assad  have pressed the lebanese state to work with damascus  which their critics strongly oppose  prime minister saad al hariri  allied to sunni saudi arabia  and others insist the united nations must oversee any repatriation   iranian backed hezbollah has played a major role in driving sunni militants from the border  and has sent thousands of its fighters into syria to support assad s government  under evacuation deals that hezbollah has brokered  thousands of refugees have left lebanon s northeast border region for syria since july  rights groups fear refugees went back because they felt under pressure in lebanon   the united nations says it is still early for safe returns  it took no part in those local deals and raised concerns they did not meet  legal standards and humanitarian principles    still  the thousands who have gone back represent a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of lebanon s refugee crisis   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

bogota  reuters    colombia s leftist farc rebel group is introducing its political party at a conference that began on sunday  a major step in its transition into a civilian organization after more than  years of war and its first chance to announce policy to skeptical voters  the six day meeting in bogota of farc members  who have handed in more than   weapons to the united nations during their demobilization  is expected to conclude on friday with a platform that the party will campaign on in elections next year  under its  peace deal with the government to end its part in a war that has killed more than   people  the majority of fighters in the group formally known as revolutionary armed forces of colombia were granted amnesty and allowed to participate in politics  whether the rebels will get backing from colombians  many of whom revile them  remains to be seen  the farc s often old fashioned marxist rhetoric strikes many as a throwback to their  founding  but proposals for reforms to complicated property laws may get traction with rural voters who struggle as subsistence farmers  the peace accord  rejected by a less than  percent margin in a referendum before being modified and enacted  awards the farc s party  automatic seats in congress through   but the group may campaign for others  in a sight that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago  farc delegates arrived by bus to the center of the capital  escorted by police on motorcycles   from this event on  we will transform into a new  exclusively political group that will carry out its activity by legal means   farc leader rodrigo londono  who is known by his nom de guerre timochenko  told hundreds of attendees at the event center in bogota   we have in front of us many challenges and many difficulties   londono said   nothing is easy in politics    rural improvements will remain a focus for the party  he added  many delegates wore conference t shirts with the slogan  a new party for a new country  and carried branded tote bags  a painting featuring images of cuban revolutionary leaders fidel castro and ernesto  che  guevara  deceased venezuelan president hugo chavez and jesus christ was on display  the party will initially be called the revolutionary alternative force of colombia  preserving the farc initials in spanish  both legislative and presidential elections will take place in   it is not yet clear in which races the farc will run candidates    i think the farc will try for a regional consolidation  using the presence and influence they have in certain provinces   said catalina jimenez  politics professor at externado university   at a national level  they need a large amount of votes they still don t have   the farc is open to coalitions  the group said this week  fractured by infighting  leftist parties have long struggled in conservative leaning colombia  despite some success in winning urban positions  widespread corruption scandals will probably be a top issue for the crowded field of  presidential candidates  campaigns are also likely to focus on proposals to improve the daily lives of colombians  many of whom say they desperately need better security  public education and healthcare  the farc says the government of president juan manuel santos  which gives a certain amount of regulated funding to each party  should help carry the costs of the conference  given the rebels have handed over their assets as reparations for victims of the war  but while the peace deal is the cornerstone of santos  legacy  the government has raised doubts about the veracity of the rebels    million asset list  the government said this week that it was forming a commission to verify that the farc had included all profits it may have earned from extortion  ransoms and drug trafficking  and the group must play by the same rules as any other party   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

t return to his home country  neighboring myanmar  until there is peace  idrees is one of around  badly injured rohingya muslims admitted to the hospital in chittagong since violence flared in rakhine state in the northwest of myanmar in late august   rohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base on aug   leading to a military crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of at least  people and sent   people fleeing to bangladesh  apart from creating a humanitarian crisis  the unrest has also brought waves of international criticism of myanmar s leader  the nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi  for not speaking out for a minority that has long complained of persecution  the rohingya are denied citizenship in myanmar  a mainly buddhist country  almost all the rohingya being treated at the chittagong medical college hospital  the largest in southeast bangladesh  have been injured by gunshots or bomb blasts  according to a hospital document given to reuters  around a third of the total injured are teenagers or younger  including a six year old boy  the myanmar military has repeatedly said that it has been targeting only insurgents in the crackdown   ajoy kumar dey  who is in charge of the hospital  said he had not seen similar wounds during previous influxes of rohingya from myanmar  he said the large number of young men and children  like idrees  underlined the gravity of the situation in rakhine    i don t remember what happened to me  but i want to go see my mother   idrees said  lying on his bed in a soiled white shirt and a checked longyi  a myanmar style sarong  his head was bandaged and he was clutching the hand of his father  sitting by his side   it hurts a lot   he cried as his father  mohammed rasheed  described how myanmar security forces sprayed bullets into their village  kyauk chaung  on the morning of aug    one bullet took off a chunk of idrees  ear as his family crouched behind a canal near their house  six fellow villagers from kyauk chaung died in the hour long shooting  said rasheed   a bleeding idrees was carried on a bamboo stretcher over some hills near the border to reach bangladesh the same night  his mother  three sisters and a brother arrived on sunday   we are lucky all of us are alive   said rasheed  across the ward  a rohingya man with bullet wounds in one shoulder  the back of a thigh and a shin  writhed in agony  a plastic nasal pipe was helping him breath  the government hospital in chittagong is usually crowded at the best of times  now it is receiving twice as many people as it has beds   many of them rohingya with shattered faces  shredded legs and damaged eyes who are fighting for their lives  around two dozen young rohingya men  some groaning in pain  were laying on blue hospital mattresses on the floor of a corridor on wednesday  their legs or hands heavily plastered  zaw htay  aung san suu kyi s spokesman  said thursday that myanmar was in discussions with dhaka on what to do about what he said were  terrorists  in the hospital  a charge the myanmar military made earlier in the week   the bangladeshi foreign secretary  shahidul haque  denied being contacted by myanmar about militants being treated at the hospital   however  he said that bangladesh had previously handed over two  terrorists  after being given their names by myanmar  he did not provide further details  but said bangladesh would hand any terrorists to myanmar if it provided more names and the individuals could be found  a united nations source said that on sept   alone   rohingya with bullet injuries and six with burn injuries were admitted to the chittagong hospital   there have been many people who have come with bullet wounds on the backs of their bodies   said h t  imam  a political adviser to prime minister sheikh hasina of bangladesh   that is most reprehensible  this is a killing mission  plain and simple   myanmar officials have said the country has the right to defend itself from attack  adding that security personnel were told to keep innocent civilians from harm  rohingya who have fled to bangladesh are in urgent need of medical and humanitarian assistance given the massive scale of the influx  doctors without borders said wednesday   many of the arrivals have serious medical needs  such as violence related injuries  severely infected wounds  and advanced obstetric complications   pavlo kolovos  the humanitarian group s head in bangladesh  said in a statement   without a scale up of humanitarian support  the potential health risks are

xiamen  china  reuters    russia reserves the right to cut further the number of u s  diplomatic staff in moscow  russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday  in response to what he called washington s  boorish  treatment of russia s diplomatic mission on u s  soil  speaking after u s  officials ordered russia to vacate diplomatic premises in several american cities  putin said he would order the russian foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of russia s property rights   that the americans reduced the number of our diplomatic facilities   this is their right   putin told a news conference in the chinese city of xiamen  where he was attending a summit of major emerging economies   the only thing is that it was done in such a clearly boorish manner  that does not reflect well on our american partners  but it s difficult to conduct a dialogue with people who confuse austria and australia  nothing can be done about it  probably such is the level of political culture of a certain part of the u s  establishment    as for our buildings and facilities  this is an unprecedented thing   putin said   this is a clear violation of russia s property rights  therefore  for a start  i will order the foreign ministry to go to court   and let s see just how efficient the much praised u s  judiciary is   a u s  state department official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said washington hoped to avoid further retaliatory actions with moscow  but was   confident in the legality  of the consular closure and restrictions ordered last week  u s  president donald trump took office in january  saying he wanted to improve ties with russia  putin also spoke favorably of trump  but relations have been damaged by accusations from u s  intelligence officials that russia sought to meddle in the presidential election  russia has denied interfering in the vote  asked by a reporter if he was disappointed with trump  putin said   whether i am disappointed or not  your question sounds very naive   he is not my bride and  likewise  i am neither his bride nor bridegroom    we are both statesmen  every nation has interests of its own  in his activities  trump is guided by the national interests of his country  and i by the interests of mine    i greatly hope that we will be able  just as the current u s  president said  to find some compromises while resolving bilateral and international problems     taking into account our joint responsibility for international security   the u s  order for russia to vacate some of its diplomatic  properties was the latest in a series of tit for tat actions that began when former u s  president barack obama  late last year  expelled  russian diplomats  the obama administration said it was retaliating for russian meddling in the u s  presidential election  in july  moscow responded  ordering the united states to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in russia by around  percent  to   moscow said the move aimed to bring the number of u s  and russian diplomats working on each other s soil to parity  but putin said the latest expulsions ordered by washington brought the number of russian diplomats on u s  soil to below parity   he said the united states was erroneously counting  russian diplomats working at the united nations headquarters in new york as being russian diplomats on u s  soil  if they are removed from the equation  putin said  russia has fewer than  diplomats in the united states   we reserve the right to take a decision on the number of u s  diplomats in moscow  but we won t do that for now  let s wait and see how the situation develops further   he said  the united states has ordered the closure of the russian consulate in san francisco and two buildings housing trade missions in washington and new york   u s  russian relations have also been badly strained by moscow s annexation of crimea in  and the subsequent separatist conflict in eastern ukraine  developments which led washington to impose economic sanctions on russia  trump  himself battling allegations that his associates colluded with russia  grudgingly signed into law the new sanctions against moscow that had been drawn up by congress  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News
johannesburg  reuters    a group of investigative journalists whose slogan is  digging dung  fertilizing democracy  is holding south african president jacob zuma to account over his widely criticized links to a family of wealthy businessmen  amabhungane  which means dung beetles in the zulu language   was founded by three veteran reporters to expose wrongdoing in south africa  together with online news site the daily maverick  amabhungane in june released leaked emails and documents that they said showed allegedly improper dealings in government contracts and influence peddling by the guptas  a family with close ties to zuma  zuma and the gupta family  which has said the emails were fake  have denied wrongdoing  co founder stefaans brummer said amabhungane  which was founded in   had spent several years probing zuma s family business dealings  and had verified the authenticity of the leaked documents   our very first stories as amabhungane was a series called  zuma inc  and we looked at the zuma family and how its business fortunes had grown since zuma took the office of president   brummer said   he said the gupta name popped up in several of amabhungane s inquiries into zuma s family business links and the organization was well placed to process the trove of information in more than   emails and documents   you fight hard for every piece of information and when something like this happens it s like christmas  you suddenly have a lot of information   said brummer  brummer said amabhungane  which mostly uses external hard drives to store documents for safety reasons  had sent a copy of the leaked gupta emails to the organized crime and corruption reporting project   a global consortium of investigative journalism centers  reuters has not independently been able to verify the allegations in the so called  guptaleaks  emails  sent between the gupta brothers and their associates  the allegations  which came after an anti corruption watchdog report into claims of influence peddling  opened zuma up to renewed scrutiny and deepened divisions within the ruling african national congress  zuma survived an attempt in parliament to force him from office on aug    but he was left politically wounded after some anc members voted with the opposition    it s quite amazing that people in south africa have woken up to  state capture  now in  when amabhungane have been exposing this for a decade   said glenda daniels  a senior media studies lecturer at the university of the witwatersrand   perhaps the nature of their exposes were rather intense and detailed for people to follow  maybe they have now let some air into their writing and everyone is getting it   as a non profit company  amabhungane s  million rand       annual budget is funded by grants from charitable foundations and public donations  it does not sell adverts or accept funds from the government or from companies  sam sole  another amabhungane co founder  said his desire to expose society s injustices drove him into journalism  both sole and brummer started their journalism careers before the end of apartheid in    during my subsequent conscription into the defense force i came face to face with the sharp  brutish reality of apartheid   and that was the impetus for my first piece of journalism   said sole   journalism  for me  was a way to fight against injustice   the third amabhungane co founder  adriaan basson  is now editor of   an online news site  sole and brummer have won numerous journalism awards  including for their reporting on a  billion rand     billion  deal to buy military equipment in the late  that was plagued by allegations of fraud and corruption   zuma was linked to the deal through his former financial adviser  who was jailed for corruption  the president said last year that an investigation into the deal found no evidence of wrongdoing  but critics denounced the findings as a cover up  all charges against zuma were dropped in   but a court last year ordered a review of the decision  zuma is appealing the ruling   the arms deal scandal lasted much longer and was much slower burning  which gave us time to develop some of the skills we use now   sole said  for amabhungane  the aim was to probe the link between politics and money   we set ourselves a target of trying to find that sweet spot of where organized crime  politics and business intersect   brummer said   politics has its good side but it has its bad side  business has its good side and its bad side  organized crime is all bad  but there is always that intersection where the three come together and that s where you get the worst wrongdoing    but amabhungane has been accused by a group called black first land first and some on social media of being run by  racist white men  and not doing enough stories on  white monopoly capital   a phrase used to describe the fact that the white minority still control much of the economy  brummer said the criticism has not deterred amabhungane   we are not going to roll over and die  investigative journalism is what we do and what we like to do   he said   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A

nairobi  reuters    kenya s supreme court ruling to scrap last month s presidential election was shaped by a new chief justice who proved a staunch defender of judicial independence on a continent where judges are often seen as being under the thumb of executive powers  david maraga s declaration that the aug   election was void and demand for a new poll with  days shocked many in the east african nation and abroad  but his announcement  after a   vote by a court panel to annul the vote  didn t surprise those who know the chief justice   we knew this case was coming and he was the man to hear it   professor tom ojienda  who worked with maraga and sits on the judicial service commission that appointed him chief justice  told reuters   he is a stickler for the rules   president uhuru kenyatta  who was expected to be sworn in for a second term until friday s supreme court ruling  said he respected the decision  but he took a swipe at maraga s colleagues  calling them  crooks  and saying the judiciary needed fixing  kenya  a u s  ally in the fight against islamists and a trade gateway to east africa  has a history of disputed votes  a  row after the  vote led to ethnic bloodshed that killed more than   people  in   a bid by veteran opponent raila odinga to secure an election rerun was rejected by the supreme court  this time  the opposition changed tack in their petition  instead of seeking to prove enough votes were fake to undermine the vote   an almost impossible task in the two weeks the court had to give its judgment   odinga s supporters sought to demonstrate that the online tallying process lacked integrity  the new approach may have been a key factor in securing a decision that had the backing of four of the panel s six judges  who have three weeks from the ruling to publish details of their decision  but the opposition also found in the chief justice a man ready to defend judicial powers against the highest office and unswayed by a tendency in kenya  a nation of more than  ethnic groups  for voters to back fellow clans people  within months of his appointment in october  maraga called out kenyatta for telling voters on a campaign stop in maraga s home region of nyamira county in april that  their son  had a job  maraga responded that his appointment had nothing to do with the president  kenyatta is a kikuyu  kenya s biggest ethnic group but still a minority  odinga is a luo  another big grouping  the chief justice is kisii  a smaller group from kenya s western highlands  maraga also sent a clear message to national leaders on aug   that the judiciary was above the political fray   the emerging culture of public lynching of judges and judicial officers by the political class is a vile affront to the rule of law and must be fiercely resisted   he said in a statement  maraga did not immediately issue a response to kenyatta s latest comments  reuters could not reach him for comment  kenyans have long complained that getting any official business done requires a  kitu kidogo   swahili for  a little something  or bribe  a frustration that is echoed across africa  but kenya has slowly rebuilt confidence in its judiciary after the post  vote violence  a new constitution in  demanded reforms of the judiciary and other public institutions  maraga  who has risen the ranks as those reforms have been implement  was known by colleagues for his strict adherence to the rules even as a young lawyer  a devout christian of the seventh day adventist tradition  he built his practice in the rift valley city of nakuru rather than to nairobi where he where he could have secured more high profile cases and would have more easily rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful  his colleagues said   if a client gave you any problem  or asked for anything  that was wrong  or refused to pay   maraga  would just say   let him go  other ones will come    said professor ojienda said  maraga s integrity and record of strictly interpreting election procedures in past polls swayed the commission to appoint him last october  ojienda said  the opposition s high hopes in  that it could overturn that election result were dashed  supreme court judges  then led by maraga s predecessor willy mutunga  rejected their petition  this time  even odinga   a former prime minister who has fought and lost three presidential races including this one   seemed surprised  after listening to friday s ruling in court  he broke out into a broad grin and pumped his fist in the air  since   several new judges were appointed to the supreme court s seven strong panel  friday s decision was backed by maraga and two others appointed after   another  who had been on the panel in   also backed the ruling  two judges dissented  while one was ill and did not vote   an election is not an event  it is a process from the beginning to the end   maraga said before reading the ruling  four years earlier  the opposition had some of their arguments thrown out as they were lodged too late  while their complaints about the widespread failure of the electronic voting systems failed to convince the judges  this time  the opposition case hinged on the election board s failure to post online tally forms from each of the   polling stations before announcing results  the forms were supposed to be signed by each party s agent  as a hard copy backup to the electronic transmission  but thousands of forms were missing from the board s website when it announced results  a report by independent court appointed experts found many forms lacked official stamps  signatures or serial numbers  that was enough to convince a majority in maraga s panel   corrects ethnicity of chief justice  paragraph   ,Not A Fake

char  developing thengar char should be given serious consideration   he said  leonard doyle  chief spokesman for the international organisation for migration  said the idea of moving refugees to the island has been talked about for years  but he hadn t heard anything new in the past few days  the island  which only emerged from the silt off bangladesh s delta coast  years ago  is two hours by

how bangladesh has been created  if there are people there  why can t the rohingya live there   he said  some officials in bangladesh s interior ministry are concerned that settling the refugees on

washington seoul  reuters    president donald trump warned on tuesday that all options are on the table for the united states to respond to north korea s firing of a ballistic missile over northern japan s hokkaido island into the sea in a new show of force  the missile test further increased tension in east asia as u s  and south korean forces conducted annual military exercises on the korean peninsula  angering pyongyang which sees the war games as a preparation for invasion  north korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests under its leader  kim jong un  in defiance of u n  sanctions  but firing projectiles over mainland japan is rare  trump  who has vowed not to let north korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the mainland united states  said the world had received north korea s latest message  loud and clear    threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the north korean regime s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world  all options are on the table   trump said in a statement  trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe spoke and agreed that north korea  poses a grave and growing direct threat  to the united states  japan and south korea  the white house said  investors flocked to safe haven assets after the missile firing  the dollar fell to its lowest in more than    years against a basket of major currencies  dxy but then rebounded  while benchmark  year u s  treasury note  rr yields fell and the price of gold xau  hit more than a nine month peak  u s  stocks  spx recovered from a sharply lower open   initial assessment indicates the north korean missile was an intermediate range ballistic missile  irbm   the pentagon said in a statement  two u s  officials said it appeared to be a kn   or hwasong   north korea s kim guided a launch of its hwasong  intermediate range ballistic missile on tuesday in a drill to counter the joint exercises by south korean and u s  militaries  the north s official kcna news agency said on wednesday   the current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the kpa in the pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing guam   kcna quoted kim as saying  pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning said diplomacy was still washington s preferred option with pyongyang  north korea was defiant   the u s  should know that it can neither browbeat the dprk with any economic sanctions and military threats and blackmail nor make the dprk flinch from the road chosen by itself   north korea s official rodong sinmun said  using the initials of the north s official name  the democratic people s republic of korea  the north vows to never give up its weapons programs  saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the united states and its allies  the united states has said before that all options  including military  are on the table  although its preference is for a diplomatic solution  the united states is technically still at war with the north because their   conflict ended in a truce  not a peace treaty  relations worsened last year when north korea staged two nuclear bomb tests  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said the launch was  absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible  and that the security council now needed to take serious action  saying  enough is enough   haley said she hoped china and russia would continue to work with the rest of the security council when it meets on tuesday afternoon to discuss what more can be done about north korea s nuclear and missile programs  the security council earlier this month unanimously imposed new sanctions on north korea after it staged two long range missile launches in july           in response to trump s statement that all options are on the table  russian u n  ambassador vassily nebenzia told reporters   it s troubling  because tensions are high and whose nerves are stronger  we don t know   a u s  official denied a report by japan s nikkei newspaper that the united states and japan will call at tuesday s meeting for an international embargo on oil exports to north korea  securing diplomatic agreement to such a ban would likely be extraordinarily difficult  diplomats say china and russia typically only view a test of a long range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible u n  sanctions  negotiations on the past three substantial u n  sanctions resolutions have taken between one and three months  the united states has proposed that the security council adopt a statement on tuesday condemning north korea s ballistic missile launch and imploring  all states to strictly  fully  and expeditiously implement  u n  sanctions on pyongyang  according to a copy of the draft statement seen by reuters   the draft statement does not threaten new security council action against north korea  in china  north korea s lone major ally  foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said the crisis was  approaching a critical juncture   but it might also be a turning point to open the door to peace talks  the launch was north korea s second since u s  secretary of state rex tillerson appeared to make a peace overture last week  by welcoming what he called the restraint pyongyang had shown by not conducting tests for several weeks  trump also expressed optimism last week about a possible improvement in relations  saying of north korea s kim   i respect the fact that he is starting to respect us      some experts in asia said kim was trying to pressure washington to get to the negotiating table with the latest missile tests    north korea  thinks that by exhibiting their capability  the path to dialogue will open   said masao okonogi  professor emeritus at japan s keio university  high flying missilesouth korea s military said the missile was launched from near the north korean capital  pyongyang  just before  a m    gmt on monday  and flew   km    miles   reaching an altitude of about  km   miles   four south korean fighter jets bombed a military firing range on tuesday after president moon jae in asked the military to demonstrate capabilities to counter north korea  south korea and the united states had discussed deploying additional  strategic assets  on the korean peninsula  south korea s presidential blue house said in a statement  without giving more details  earlier this month  north korea threatened to fire four missiles into the sea near the u s  pacific territory of guam after trump said it would face  fire and fury  if it threatened the united states  north korea fired what it said was a rocket carrying a communications satellite into orbit over japan in  after warning of its plan  the united states  japan and south korea considered it a ballistic missile test  the latest missile fell into the sea   km   miles  east of hokkaido  the japanese government said  in many northern japanese towns  sirens wailed and loudspeakers urged residents to take precautions  sending some scrambling to leave their houses while others confessed they had no idea what they should do  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake

washington  reuters    president donald trump  like his predecessors  may find that neither negotiations nor economic and military pressure can force north korea to abandon its nuclear program  and that the united states has no choice but to try to contain it and deter north korean leader kim jong un from ever using a nuclear weapon  north korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept    describing it as an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long range missile  a dramatic escalation of its stand off with the united states and its allies  u s  officials declined to discuss operational planning  but acknowledge that no existing plan for a preemptive strike could promise to prevent a brutal counterattack by north korea  which has thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on seoul  in an implicit recognition that the military options against the north are unpalatable at best and pyrrhic at worst  u s  defense secretary jim mattis last week told reporters   we are never out of diplomatic solutions   u s  and asian officials believe it is necessary to try negotiations and more economic pressure but concede these are unlikely to curb  let alone eliminate  the nuclear and missile programs that north korean considers essential to its survival  that leaves washington and its allies in south korea  japan and elsewhere with an unwelcome question  is there any way to live with a nuclear armed north korea  one that is contained and deterred from using its nuclear weaponry  trump declined to answer that question at a news conference on thursday  saying he would not disclose his negotiating strategy publicly and adding it would be a  very sad day  for north korea if the u s  military settles the matter    military action would certainly be an option  is it inevitable  nothing is inevitable   trump said   still  a senior trump administration official said it is unclear whether the cold war era deterrence model that washington used with the soviet union could be applied to a rogue state like north korea  adding   i don t think the president wants to take that chance    we are very concerned that north korea might not be able to be deterred   the official said  speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity shortly after trump s remarks  among the u s  options to strengthen its deterrent is the long planned modernization of america s aging nuclear forces that would assure that north korea would be destroyed if it fired a nuclear tipped missile at the united states  a u s  military base  japan  or south korea  another is stepped up investment in u s  missile defenses  particularly testing  research and development of technologies that could defeat a significant number of incoming missiles  both steps would need to avoid triggering new arms races with beijing and moscow  experts say  another factor weighing on pentagon planners is their readiness for a major conventional conflict after  years of war in afghanistan  iraq  syria and elsewhere  there has been no sign the white house  which has been cool to the idea of talks and hopes pressure can change the north s calculus  is ready to settle for a containment strategy  despite pessimism about talks  a u s  official speaking on condition of anonymity said there was a chance that economic pressure  especially from china  combined with an agreement to negotiate could convince pyongyang to limit its nuclear arsenal or even sign the  comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty   signing the ctbt would given the north tacit admission to the nuclear club but end its testing program   the official said   that  along with assured destruction  might be the best that could be done   the remaining question  however  is whether trump would be willing to settle for that   discipline and steadiness are not words one usually uses in a sentence that also has the name donald trump   said robert einhorn  a former state department official who negotiated with north korea and is now at the brookings institution think tank   would he over time recognize that he may have no choice   frank jannuzi  president of the mansfield foundation  which promotes u s  asia relations  is more optimistic   does he have the patience to manage a difficult process of deterrence and containment against the  north  rather than doing something impulsive  i think so   he said   some of his deals have taken years to come to fruition   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

beijing  reuters    the recent scene at a dusty inner mongolia military base provided evidence of chinese president xi jinping s consolidation of political power  even as he faces pushback from some quarters in his ruling communist party ahead of a critical gathering next month  dressed in army fatigues  xi reviewed a military parade on july  marking the  founding anniversary of the people s liberation army  pla   breaking with precedent at such events  xi   who is head of the party and the military as well as president   did not share the stage with peers or party elders  pla general fan changlong  in a further departure from the norm  hailed xi as  lingxiu   or leader  a reverent honorific bestowed only on two others since the  founding of the people s republic of china  chairman mao zedong and his short lived successor  hua guofeng  according to six sources with ties to the leadership  as well as chinese analysts and foreign diplomats  that display and others sent a clear signal of his increasingly dominant position in the runup to the party s congress starting on oct    a meeting that is only held once every five years  rana mitter  director of the university of oxford china centre  said the  lingxiu  title would suggest xi had succeeded in one of his key aims to  centralize as much authority and charisma under his own person  as possible  but as xi s supporters promote his agenda  some party insiders  wary that he will accumulate too much power and effectively end three decades of collective leadership  have delayed agreement on who will end up on the party s standing committee  the apex of power  currently made up of seven men   there is opposition to xi getting too much power   said a source with ties to the leadership  the state council information office  which doubles as the party s spokesman s office  did not respond to a request for comment for this story  as is typical in the run up to the congress  competing name lists have been circulating in leadership circles for the standing committee  but sources caution they are possibilities rather than the final line up   there is an anti xi faction forming up   said a beijing based diplomatic source  citing meetings he has had with chinese officials   it remains to be seen if he ll get it all his own way for the standing committee   key questions include whether xi ally and top corruption buster wang qishan will stay on past traditional retirement age and  whether xi will get his supporters in all the key positions  there will also be a lot of attention on any moves that would enable xi to stay on in some top leadership capacity after his second term ends in   xi is required by the country s constitution to step down as president after two five year terms  there is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief  though a maximum  year term is the norm  distinct from the standard usage of  lingdao  for leader   lingxiu  evokes grander  almost spiritual  connotations   the party is gearing up to put xi on the same level as mao   another  beijing based diplomatic source said  referring to the significance of the  lingxiu  term   the central party school  which is the top training ground for up and coming cadres and is influential in interpreting and disseminating party directives  has since the military parade used  lingxiu  in official party language to refer to xi   the study times  the school s official newspaper  referred  to xi as  lingxiu  for the first time on aug      this is the choice made by history  made by the people   it said  the military s official pla daily also referred to xi as  lingxiu  on aug    however  the people s daily  the party s official newspaper  has yet to call xi  lingxiu    if xi becomes  lingxiu  at the congress  it would be tantamount to being party chairman   another source with leadership ties said   xi is currently the party s general secretary  but not chairman  china s first three leaders after the founding of the people s republic in  all carried the title party chairman  mao  hua and then hu yaobang  it has not been used since   it would be a life long tenure   the source said  adding that adopting such a title would be easier than amending the party charter to resurrect the chairmanship  which was abolished in the early  to prevent another mao like personality cult  xi added  core  to his slew of titles last october   if he were to be formally anointed  lingxiu  during the congress  his political clout would eclipse that of the past few presidents  the sources said  it would effectively grant him veto power on any major decision put to the standing committee  they said  for decades  the communist party general secretary has been technically first among equals in the standing committee under a collective leadership model designed to avoid one man rule  while western analysts largely view xi s centralization of authority as having a possibly narrowing effect on china s potential for further radical economic reform  three sources with leadership ties said xi wants a strong hand precisely to force through changes that are resisted by vested interests   this kind of title is essential   a source with ties to the leadership told reuters   china at this juncture needs this kind of powerful man in control   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake

jakarta  reuters    during the first months of this year  president joko widodo was an embattled leader grappling with indonesia s most serious political and religious tensions in two decades  now  he has come through the storm looking stronger than ever  his popularity is near record highs and  thanks to deft maneuvers against foes trying to exploit a blasphemy case against one of his allies  widodo has stamped his authority on the ruling coalition  parliament and the security forces  the quietly spoken former furniture salesman may have proved his political mettle  but his next challenge is an economy that refuses to respond to conventional policies to fire up growth  that could dent his re election chances in   especially with a budget that won t stretch to lavish government spending  senior government officials worry that widodo has been distracted by the battles with political opponents and taken his eye off the economy   we are suffering from bad policy right now     if we don t fix it or we don t regain the initiative i could easily see gdp growth going down  and is that a risk you want to take   said one senior government official  who asked not to be identified  according to a june survey  nearly  percent of people polled were satisfied with widodo s performance  almost an all time high  but the poll also showed high expectations that he would deliver on promises to revive the lackluster economy   if he doesn t perform on the economy  that would give ammunition to the opposition to challenge jokowi in    said djayadi hanan of the saiful mujani research center  a jakarta based pollster  using the president s nickname  indonesia s gdp growth has shambled at around  percent for the past two years  too low to lift the country out of the middle income trap  largely because domestic consumption   once the engine of the economy   and bank lending have been sluggish  an unexpected cut in interest rates last month highlighted the struggle to lift growth despite government initiatives  including a tax amnesty program  an infrastructure drive  and a series of regulatory tweaks designed to make business easier  the government has little fiscal room to breathe life into the economy  the budget deficit is already close to a legally mandated ceiling of  percent of gdp and parliament could impeach widodo if he allowed the deficit to run past that limit  david sumual  chief economist at indonesia s bank central asia  said a hike in electricity tariffs and slow disbursement of subsidies to farmers have weakened the purchasing power of middle  to lower income households  meanwhile  higher income groups are worried that the government is pushing for aggressive tax reform that will leave them less well off   the problem now is confidence in the prospect of the economy  people don t want to spend   sumual said  in his state of the nation address last month  widodo pledged to tackle income inequality by cutting red tape and making land acquisition easier to accelerate infrastructure projects  and last week he urged his cabinet to focus on attracting investment to boost growth and create jobs  but two officials who spoke to reuters said they worried he was not matching his rhetoric with bold steps that need to be taken now for growth to be marching higher next year  when campaigning for the  presidential election will begin  on the to do list remains finding a way to rein in the overbearing dominance of state owned enterprises on the economy  which was singled out by the world bank in july as something preventing private funds flowing in  in addition  there is a need to speed up efforts to tackle a tortuous regulatory and licensing regime to lift investment  an area where widodo said last week  during the launch of a new policy package   there s so much we have to improve  so much to fix   just months ago  widodo appeared to be fighting for his political survival as political opponents joined forces with radical islamist groups to foment popular fury over alleged blasphemous comments made by widodo s ally basuki tjahaja purnama  the former christian governor of jakarta  amid massive protests in central jakarta  there were rumors of treason plots and even a military takeover   beating the drum of indonesia s  unity in diversity  motto  widodo embarked on a frenzy of public appearances at military barracks  the homes of both political rivals and allies  and at moderate islamic boarding schools   all aimed at projecting an image of unity and control   he has been busy in the past six to eight months fighting back against destabilizing forces   said endy bayuni  editor in chief of the most widely read english daily  the jakarta post   he s showed that he is very much in control of the situation and has become even more mature as a politician   widodo s latest move to regain political authority took aim at hardline islamist groups  by executive decree  he banned hizb ut tahrir  a group that calls for indonesia to be ruled by islamic sharia law  saying its ambitions ran counter to the country s secular ideology  such political dominance could provide widodo with a false sense of security  the senior government official said   the dark side of the story is     the economy   he said   i think the biggest threat now  potentially   and it s the flip side of the incredibly strong political position he is in   would be complacency   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

washington  reuters    president donald trump on sunday delivered a more orderly  less haphazard response than he has offered to other provocations by north korea after pyongyang conducted a powerful nuclear test that intensified the pressure on his young presidency  trump s handling of pyongyang s nuclear test reflected a more traditional approach to crisis management  which u s  officials said illustrated the influence of the new white house chief of staff  retired marine corps general john kelly  and defense secretary jim mattis  that included the tone the president struck in some early morning tweets  a meeting on the crisis that trump convened on sunday was limited to top aides and generals directly involved  in the past  according to administration officials  white house aides and others wandered in and out of such discussions   contributing to an impression of policymaking chaos  after the meeting  mattis  also a retired marine corps general  appeared before reporters  along with joint chiefs of staff chairman general joseph dunford  to warn north korea of u s  military resolve  trump himself was more restrained  last month  he inflamed tensions by declaring that north korea might face  fire and fury like the world has never seen   when asked on sunday if he planned to launch an attack  he said only   we ll see    north korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to china  which is trying to help but with little success   trump said on twitter  a u s  official who has participated in the discussions of how to respond to the north s sixth nuclear test  which pyongyang says was of an advanced hydrogen bomb  told reuters the u s  response thus far reflected an improved organization   if today s meeting and the president s public remarks on twitter  and the outreach to our allies and others by rex and others is an early indication  the process is at least more orderly   said the official  referring to secretary of state rex tillerson  the crisis is also presenting a test for kelly  who officials said was trying to rein in the president s more combative impulses and place limits on who gets access to him  the republican president has sometimes chafed at the restrictions his new chief of staff has imposed on the information flow in and out of the oval office in a bid to streamline the decision making process  people familiar with the situation said   you can t manage trump like that   said one outside trump adviser  who predicted the president would eventually tire of the process  a second official familiar with the situation noted that  kelly s influence extends so far    the president is still the commander in chief  and he has his bully pulpit in twitter   said that official  who also requested anonymity to discuss internal white house matters  if there was a discordant note on sunday  it might have been when trump took to twitter to admonish south korea  a key ally  for what he termed a policy of  appeasement  of north korea   south korea is finding  as i have told them  that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work  they  north korea  only understand one thing   he said on twitter  a former senior state department official criticized trump for making the remark   it was unseemly  unhelpful  and divisive to gratuitously slap our major ally at the very moment when the threat from  north korea  has reached a new height   said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  mattis has a closer relationship with trump than do kelly  national security adviser h r  mcmaster and tillerson  and had played the leading role in explaining to the president the military options and the dangerous implications of using any of them  the second u s  official said   it s no accident that it was mattis who spoke to the media after the meeting   the official said   both officials said trump had been briefed on north korea multiple times since taking office in january  but had pushed back against the idea that military action would be so costly that it should remain a last resort  most military scenarios predict that a strike on north korea would bring a massive missile and artillery response against south korea and its capital  seoul  resulting in mass casualties  for now  the strategy emerging in the white house includes greater economic pressure on china to step in to help resolve the crisis  officials said  beijing denies it has sufficient influence on pyongyang  the effort was signaled by treasury secretary steven mnuchin  who told  fox news sunday  that he was drafting a sanctions package in which  anybody who wants to do trade or business with them  north korea  would be prevented from doing trade or business with us   china is north korea s biggest trading partner  a recent round of u s  sanctions targeted some chinese financial institutions  but administration officials said a broader effort was being contemplated  whether trump would launch such an effort is far from clear  he has sought to impose tariffs against chinese steel imports but has been persuaded by his advisers not to take such a step because it could start a trade war  ,Not

glasgow  scotland  reuters    scotland s former first minister believes the independence movement has a three year window after britain quits the european union to push again for seccession  despite the scottish national party s losses in an election in june  salmond  who is still very influential in the movement  said the independence drive could be refreshed by proposing to join the european free trade association  which would give scotland european single market membership   the snp lost a third of its seats in the national election  including salmond s own seat  in a sign of waning enthusiasm for another scottish independence referendum after the uncertainties thrown up by brexit  despite that  support for independence itself has remained at the  percent level it was when it was voted down in  and the snp still holds  of scotland s  seats in the westminster parliament   salmond said brexit was proving to be disastrous for britain and would only end in  humiliation   scotland and northern ireland voted to keep eu membership while wales and most populous england voted to leave at last year s referendum  straining the ties of the four nation united kingdom    so the snp were and are right about brexit  but as we found out to our cost in the election just being right does not necessarily make for popularity  nor does it absolve us of a responsibility to attempt to create order out of chaos   he told a business for scotland annual dinner    we have  months of brexit negotiations and after that perhaps a three year period of transition to get our ducks in a row  salmond said  in a speech peppered with jibes at the government s brexit talks  which have faltered in recent weeks  he said that efta membership could be a prelude to full eu membership if necessary    we have to offer something which is doable  feasible and speedily deliverable for the european connections of an independent scotland   he said  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

the eye of hurricane irma  reuters    the sky darkened  lightning flashed and a jolt of turbulence shook the cabin of the hulking air force turbo prop aircraft as it plied its way toward the eye of hurricane irma  one of the strongest atlantic storms ever recorded  piloting the four engine  wc  aircraft was air force reserve lieutenant colonel jim hitterman  who over the past  years has flown into  to  hurricanes   every storm is different but he likens the experience to driving through a car wash   with one big difference   as you re driving through that car wash  a bunch of gorillas start jumping on top of your car   hitterman said  adding that sometimes shaking gets so bad  he cannot see his instruments   on friday and saturday  reuters accompanied the air force reserves   hurricane hunters   whose hard won data taken directly from the center of storms like hurricane irma are critical to u s  forecasts that save lives  experts say u s  satellite data simply cannot do the job   we can estimate by satellite what the strength and size of a hurricane is  but only if you go into the hurricane can you really get an accurate measure of its exact center location  the structure  the maximum winds   said rick knabb  a hurricane expert at the weather channel and a former director the national hurricane center  the  weather reconnaissance squadron s  hurricane hunters  are based at keesler air force base in biloxi  mississippi  its members trace the origin of hurricane hunting to a  barroom dare by two then army air corps pilots to fly through a hurricane off texas  today  the missions are carried out largely by air force reservists who  after a few days or weeks of chasing storms  return to their jobs in the civilian world  hitterman    flies for delta airlines most of the time and  as a hobby  races motorcycles   the flight meteorologist  major nicole mitchell  is an experienced television news meteorologist and mother of an eight month old baby boy  she normally lives in minnesota  the way mitchell sees it  the more accurate her data is  the more accurate the forecasts can be that tell u s  citizens whether to evacuate their homes as irma or other storms advance   it s a fact that we make a difference   she said  mitchell s plane would make four passes in total through irma s eye during that mission  some entries and exits more turbulent than others  its final pass came on saturday  as hurricane irma walloped cuba s northern coast  irma s interaction with cuba s terrain weakened the storm from a category  to a category  hurricane but u s  national hurricane center warned the storm was anticipated to strengthen again   irma was expected to hit florida on sunday morning  bringing massive damage from wind and flooding to america s fourth largest state by population  millions of florida residents have been ordered to evacuate  despite the severity of storms like irma and the undeniable danger on the ground  these u s  flights into hurricanes have an incredible safety record   not one aircraft has been lost in more than four decades  the last time was in   but they are not without risk  some six hurricane or typhoon hunting aircraft have been lost in total  costing  lives  according to the weather underground website  jeff masters  director of meteorology of the weather underground  recalled an extremely close call during a flight into hurricane hugo in  organized by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa   which also fields its own turbo prop aircraft   the pilot lost control of the aircraft  one of the engines caught on fire  and the aircraft descended rapidly  all because satellite data had given his crew the sense they were flying into a category  storm  it turned out to be a category   they were flying much too low for a storm that potent    we went in at   feet  which is a no no in a category  and we got clobbered   recounted masters  the pilot was able to recover control after entering hugo s eye  on the mission into irma  jolts of turbulence also shook the equipment in the cabin as it neared the eye of the hurricane  emergency parachutes swayed   but then  suddenly  everything in the plane settled down   it was safe enough to take off seat belts  the flying was smooth    inside the eye  the sky opened up  the dark  eyewall    the surrounding ring of clouds   could be seen outside the cockpit window  masters says someday drones might be able to do the risky job now done by experienced air crews   but  from the cockpit of this hurricane hunter flight  that possibility still seems distant   this aircraft  like all of the  s  wc  planes  are     specially equipped to gather meteorological data and send it to the u s  national hurricane center  some of that equipment is operated manually   that includes releasing sensors through the belly of the aircraft that  as they fall  transmit storm data including irma s pressure  wind speed and direction  as the mission got underway  the sensors   known as dropsondes   appeared to be malfunctioning  technical sergeant karen moore  the loadmaster who releases the dropsondes from the aircraft  among many other duties  said she could not get its gps signal as it fell into irma s winds  so  moore took out a screwdriver and literally started fixing them on the fly  one by one  that is something a drone would not be able to do  hitterman said he also could see a future where pilotless planes fly into hurricanes to get the data americans need    but i think it s a ways off   he said  ,Not A Fake

beijing  reuters    when kim jong un inherited power in north korea in late   then chinese president hu jintao was outwardly supportive of the untested young leader  predicting that  traditional friendly cooperation  between the countries would strengthen  two years later  kim ordered the execution of his uncle jang song thaek  the country s chief interlocutor with china and a relatively reform minded official in the hermetic state  since then  ties between the allies have deteriorated so sharply that some diplomats and experts fear beijing may become  like washington  a target of its neighbor s ire   while the united states and its allies   and many people in china   believe beijing should do more to rein in pyongyang  the acceleration of north korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near total breakdown of high level diplomacy between the two  before retiring this summer  china s long time point man on north korea  wu dawei  had not visited the country for over a year  his replacement  kong xuanyou  has yet to visit and is still carrying out duties from his previous asian role  traveling to pakistan in mid august  diplomats say  the notion that mighty china wields diplomatic control over impoverished north korea is mistaken  said jin canrong  an international relations professor at beijing s renmin university   there has never existed a subordinate relationship between the two sides  never  especially after the end of the cold war  the north koreans fell into a difficult situation and could not get enough help from china  so they determined to help themselves   a famine in the mid  that claimed anywhere from   to three million north koreans was a turning point for the economy  forcing private trade on the collectivized state  that allowed the north a degree of independence from outside aid and gave credence to the official  juche  ideology of self reliance   china fought alongside north korea during the   korean war  in which chinese leader mao zedong lost his eldest son  and beijing has long been pyongyang s chief ally and primary trade partner  while their relationship has always been clouded by suspicion and mistrust  china grudgingly tolerated north korea s provocations as preferable to the alternatives  chaotic collapse that spills across their border  and a korean peninsula under the domain of a u s  backed seoul government  that is also the reason china is reluctant to exert its considerable economic clout  worried that measures as drastic as the energy embargo proposed this week by washington could lead to the north s collapse  instead  china repeatedly calls for calm  restraint and a negotiated solution  the north korean government does not provide foreign media with a contact point in pyongyang for comment by email  fax or phone  the north korean embassy in beijing was not immediately available for comment  china s foreign ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment  it has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls the  china responsibility theory  and insists the direct parties   north korea  south korea and the united states   hold the key to resolving tensions   until his death in   north korean leader kim jong il made numerous entreaties to ensure china would back his preferred son as successor   while then president hu reciprocated  the younger kim  in his late  at the time  began to distance himself from his country s most powerful ally   there s a lot of domestic politics in north korea where this young leader who isn t well known  he s not proven yet  especially has to show that he s not in the pocket of beijing   said john delury of seoul s yonsei university   i think he made the decision first to keep hu jintao and then  current president  xi jinping really at bay   within months of coming to power  kim telegraphed north korea s intentions by amending its constitution to proclaim itself a nuclear state  the execution of jang in  sealed beijing s distrust of the young leader   of course the chinese were not happy   said a foreign diplomat in beijing focused on north korea   executing your uncle  that s from the feudal ages   in an attempt to warm ties  xi sent high ranking communist party official liu yunshan to attend the north s october  military parade marking the  anniversary of the founding of the workers  party of korea  liu hand delivered a letter from xi praising kim s leadership and including congratulations not just from the chinese communist party but xi s personal  cordial wishes  in a powerful show of respect  xi s overture has been repaid with increasingly brazen actions by pyongyang  which many observers believe are timed for maximum embarrassment to beijing  sunday s nuclear test  for example  took place as china hosted a brics summit  while in may  the north launched a long range missile just hours before the belt and road forum  dedicated to xi s signature foreign policy initiative  mao zedong s description of north korea s relationship with china is typically mischaracterised as being as close as  lips and teeth   his words are better translated as   if the lips are gone  the teeth will be cold   a reference to the strategic importance of the north as a geographical security buffer  despite its resentment at the pressure north korea s actions have put it under  beijing refrains from taking too hard a line  it said little when kim jong un s half brother was assassinated in february at kuala lumpur s airport  the half brother  kim jong nam  had been seen as a potential rival for power in pyongyang and had lived for years in beijing  then macau  an editorial in china s influential global times warned after pyongyang s latest nuclear test that cutting off north korea s oil would redirect the conflict to one between north korea and china  zhao tong  a north korea expert at the carnegie tsinghua center in beijing  said north korea was deeply unhappy with china s backing of earlier un sanctions   if china supports more radical economic sanctions that directly threaten the stability of the regime  then it is possible that north korea becomes as hostile to china as to

northwestern jungles  colombia  reuters    colombia s eln guerrilla group said a russian armenian citizen it held hostage for six months was killed in april while trying to escape  a startling admission that risks throwing current peace talks with the government into jeopardy   in a rare interview  a commander of the national liberation army  colombia s last active guerrilla group  said that ransoms from kidnappings were necessary to keep its fighters in the field and that peace would be impossible without state funding to feed and clothe the rebels  the eln seized arsen voskanyan in november  the group claimed that he was collecting endangered  poisonous frogs in the jungles of the northwestern department of choco and accused him of wanting to smuggle wildlife overseas   after his lengthy captivity  voskanyan was shot when he grabbed a hand grenade in a bid to escape  according to the eln commander  who would only give his nom de guerre yerson    he s dead   yerson told reuters in a remote area along the banks of a river that sees frequent combat between the leftist rebels  government troops and right wing paramilitaries   the grenade exploded     several of our boys were wounded  the entire unit of five boys  he fled  he was shot and killed     the issue of his body will be negotiated   he said  adding that the death took place within his unit  yerson supplied no evidence to back up his assertions  another person with knowledge of the matter also subsequently confirmed that voskanyan had been killed   reuters could not independently confirm the circumstances surrounding voskanyan s death  colombia s government said it knows nothing of the eln s claim and the last it knew was a statement from the eln that said he had escaped   the responsibility is with the eln   the senior official said  asking not to be named  the russian embassy in colombia  colombia s high peace commissioner and the foreign ministry in moscow did not immediately respond to requests for comment  the eln s practice of kidnapping civilians is a key issue at peace talks taking place in the ecuadorean capital of quito  the fact that voskanyan was killed as talks progress and the eln failed to inform the government may complicate already tricky negotiations to end  years of war and make the need to agree a ceasefire more pressing   it makes it urgent to get a bilateral  verifiable ceasefire as soon as possible so this doesn t keep happening   leftist senator antonio navarro wolff  who once belonged to now demobilized urban guerrilla group the m   told reuters  yerson and his troops said they are not optimistic a peace agreement can be reached because neither side will give ground on kidnapping  the eln has refused to stop taking hostages for ransom  launching bomb attacks and extorting foreign oil and mining companies while talks are ongoing  the government has said it will not move forward on issues like a bilateral ceasefire until it does  talks with the eln are being held as the revolutionary armed forces of colombia  farc   until this year the biggest rebel group  has demobilized  formed a new political party and ended its part in a civil war that killed more than   people and displaced millions over five decades  his face covered by a thin black balaclava and wearing a beret and camouflage fatigues  yerson    said he has been fighting in colombia s jungles and mountains  for many  many years    flanked by two fighters carrying semi automatic rifles as other rebels watched on  he questioned the government s willingness to make sufficient concessions but said he would adhere to the wishes of his leadership if a peace deal was reached  the eln has sought peace before  holding talks in cuba and venezuela between  and   but experts have said those discussions were dogged by lack of will on both sides  yerson is the commander of the ernesto  che  guevara front  that fights under the command of the eln leader known as uriel who commands the western war block omar gomez  he declined to say how many rebels fight in his unit  the eln   which has kidnapped hundreds of colombians and foreigners for economic and political gain   previously said in a statement that voskanyan escaped injured after a struggle that left several fighters wounded as they tried to release him to the international committee of the red cross  the killing of voskanyan may turn already dire public perception further against the eln  analyst ariel avila told reuters   the impact will be on public opinion and in the questioning of the talks   he said  inspired by the cuban revolution and established by radical catholic priests in   the eln was close to disappearing in the  but steadily gained power again   by  it had as many as   fighters  financed by  war taxes  levied on landowners and oil companies  it is now believed to have about   fighters  but yerson  who would not confirm the number  said the group is heavily recruiting   considered a terrorist group by the united states and the european union  the eln has stepped up attacks on economic infrastructure this year  hitting oil pipelines and power lines repeatedly  president juan manuel santos  who meted out some of the most crushing military blows against the farc and earned a nobel peace prize last year for his efforts at peace  has had less success with the eln  which moves in mobile units of four or so fighters   the eln has said it may declare a temporary ceasefire to honor pope francis during his visit next week to colombia  ,Not A

drew no formal response from the military or the government of buddhist majority myanmar  however  the spokesman for myanmar s leader  aung san suu kyi  said on twitter   we have no policy to negotiate with terrorists   myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against arsa  which the government has declared a terrorist organisation  human rights

administration seeks increased economic sanctions  saying pyongyang was  behaving badly and it s got to stop    military action would certainly be an option  is it inevitable  nothing is inevitable   trump said during a news conference  i would prefer not going the route of the military   trump said   if we do use it on north korea  it will be a very sad day for north korea   even as trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk to north korea  senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution remains open  especially given the u s  assessment that any pre emptive strike would unleash massive north korean retaliation  while trump talked tough on north korea  china agreed on thursday that the united nations should take more action against pyongyang but also kept pushing for dialogue to help resolve the standoff  north korea  which is pursuing its nuclear and missile program in defiance of international condemnation  said it would respond to any new u n  sanctions and u s  pressure with  powerful counter measures   accusing the united states of aiming for war  the united states wants the u n  security council to impose an oil

seen by reuters on wednesday  pressure from washington has ratcheted up since north korea conducted its nuclear test on sunday  that test  along with a series of missile launches  showed it was close to achieving its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon that could reach the united states   given the new developments on the korean peninsula  china agrees that the u n  security council should make a further response and take necessary measures   chinese foreign minister wang yi told reporters   any new actions taken by the international community against the dprk should serve the purpose of curbing the dprk s nuclear and missile programs  while at the same time be conducive to restarting dialogue and consultation   he said  referring to north korea by the initials of its official name  the democratic people s republic of korea  china is by far north korea s biggest trading partner  accounting for  percent of two way trade last year  it also provides hundreds of

aug   and an army counter offensive  but said her administration was trying its best to take care of all citizens  western critics have accused suu kyi of not speaking out for the rohingya  some   million people who have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in buddhist majority myanmar as illegal migrants from bangladesh   some have called for the nobel peace prize she won in  as

state  which ruled over millions of people in both iraq and syria at its peak in   is falling back on a last euphrates stronghold downstream of deir al zor city in the towns of al mayadin and al bukamal  near the border with iraq   but as it has lost its core territory   defeated in iraq s mosul now yielding street after street in syria s raqqa   the ultra hardline group has still been able to launch attacks in the west and maintain a threat in other centers such as libya  the fighters have been driven out of nearly all of their territory in iraq over the past two years by government

commander in the pro assad alliance said   the latest advance came after intense preparatory artillery  a multi pronged assault and gains in high ground commanding nearby areas  the non syrian commander said   meanwhile  as the army and its allies have forced other militant pockets to surrender  including an islamic state enclave on syria s border with lebanon a week ago  they have been able to transfer more troops to the desert campaign    it helped a lot to switch the military effort of the syrian army and the resistance to the eastern syrian desert   the commander said  adding that thousands of troops had arrived from the battle on the lebanon border   islamic state fighters and their families evacuated from that enclave as part of a surrender deal were escorted by the syrian army and hezbollah to east syria  but have been stopped by a u s  led coalition from reaching deir al zor   ten of the original  buses are now stuck in no man s land between pro government

caracas washington   reuters    u s  president donald trump signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the venezuelan government or its state oil company on friday in an effort to halt financing that the white house said fuels president nicolas maduro s  dictatorship   maduro  who has frequently blamed the united states for waging an  economic war  on venezuela  said the united states was seeking to force venezuela to default   but he said it would not succeed  the order is washington s biggest sanctions blow to date against maduro and is intended to punish his leftist government for what trump has called an erosion of democracy in the oil rich country  which is already reeling from an economic crisis  it suggests a weakening in already strained relations between the two countries  just three days ago  maduro said the relations between caracas and washington were at their lowest point ever   all they re trying to do to attack venezuela is crazy   said maduro on a tv broadcast on friday   with the efforts of our people  it will fail and venezuela will be stronger  more free  and more independent   venezuela faces a severe recession with millions suffering food and medicine shortages and soaring inflation  the south american nation relies on oil for some  percent of export revenue  citgo petroleum   the u s  refiner of venezuela s ailing state run oil company pdvsa  is  practically  being forced to close by the order  warned maduro  adding that a preliminary analysis showed the sanctions would impede venezuelan crude exports to the united states  he said he was calling  urgent  meetings with u s  clients of venezuelan oil  the new sanctions ban trade in any new issues of u s  dollar denominated debt of the venezuelan government and pdvsa  because the ban applies to use of the u s  financial system   as a result  it will be it tricky for pdvsa to refinance its heavy debt burden  investors had expected that pdvsa would seek to ease upcoming payments through such an operation  as it did last year  which usually requires that new bonds be issued  additional financial pressure on pdvsa could push the cash strapped company closer to a possible default  or bolster its reliance on key allies china and russia  which have already lent caracas billions of dollars    they want us to fall into default   said maduro  adding that just under two thirds of venezuelan bond holders are in the united states  maduro insisted that venezuela would continue paying its debts  the decision also blocks citgo petroleum from sending dividends back to the south american nation  a senior official said  in a further blow to pdvsa s coffers  however  the order stops short of a major ban on crude trading that could have disrupted venezuela s oil industry and worsened the country s faltering economy  it also protects holders of most existing venezuelan government and pdvsa bonds  who were relieved the sanctions did not go further  venezuelan and pdvsa bonds were trading broadly higher on friday afternoon   maduro may no longer take advantage of the american financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the venezuelan economy at the expense of the venezuelan people   u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday  venezuela s oil ministry and pdvsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment   pdvsa  the financial engine of maduro s government  is already struggling due to low global oil prices  mismanagement  allegations of corruption and a brain drain  washington last month sanctioned pdvsa s finance vice president  simon zerpa  complicating some of the company s operations as americans are now banned from doing business with him  trump has so far spared venezuela from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry  but officials have said such actions are under consideration  the republican president has also warned of a  military option  for venezuela  although white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster said on friday that no such actions are anticipated in the  near future   venezuela has for months struggled to find financing because of pdvsa s cash flow problems and corruption scandals have led institutions to tread cautiously  regardless of sanctions  russia and its state oil company rosneft have emerged as an increasingly important source of financing for pdvsa  according to a reuters report    on at least two occasions  the venezuelan government has used russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders  a high level pdvsa official told reuters   at this point our view is that the country can scrape by without defaulting this year  largely with the help of chinese and russian backing and by further squeezing imports  next year is a tossup   said raul gallegos  an analyst with the consultancy control risks  however  china has grown reticent to extend further loans because of payment delays and corruption  russia has been negotiating financing in exchange for oil assets in venezuela  sources have told reuters  but going forward it would be difficult for the opec member to provide enough assets to keep up loans destined for bond payments  venezuela s government has around   billion in available cash to make    billion in bond payments by the end of the year and to cover the import of food and medicine  according to documents reviewed by reuters  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

yangon shamlapur  bangladesh  reuters    myanmar said on wednesday it was negotiating with china and russia to ensure they block any u n  security council censure over the violence that has forced an exodus of nearly   rohingya muslims to bangladesh in less than two weeks  myanmar leader aung san suu kyi blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in the northwestern state of rakhine but  in a statement  she made no mention of the rohingya who have fled  suu kyi has come under increasing pressure from countries with muslim populations  including indonesia  where

region  myanmar national security adviser thaung tun said myanmar was counting on china and russia  both permanent members of the security council  to block a u n  resolution on the crisis   we are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the security council   he told a news conference   china is our friend and we have a similar friendly relationship with russia  so it will not be possible for that issue to go forward   russia s u n  ambassador vassily nebenzia said he believed the  member security council had sent a signal  by meeting behind closed doors on the issue a week ago  that it would like to see the situation calm down    we called for restraint   he told reporters on tuesday   the security council for the time being did what it could do   the u s  state department said washington was  deeply concerned by sustained reports of significant violence and the impact on civilian populations  including the rohingya community   these reports include allegations of violence conducted by security forces and civilians  as well as additional attacks by arsa   a spokesman said  referring to arakan rohingya solidarity organization insurgents   the spokesman said the united states had discussed the issue with myanmar  at the highest levels  and was also in touch with its neighbors and other international partners   we welcome indications that the government is committed to providing access to humanitarian aid via the red cross  and we look forward to learning further details   he added   reuters reporters in bangladesh s cox s bazar region

with virtually nothing so there has to be food   a u n  source working there said   so this is now a huge concern   where is this food coming from for at least the elderly  the children  the women who

he says are facing genocide  in a statement issued by her office on facebook  suu kyi said the government had  already started defending all the people in rakhine in the best way possible  and warned against misinformation that could mar relations with other countries  she referred to images on twitter of killings posted by turkey s deputy prime minister that he later deleted because they were not from myanmar   she said that kind of fake information which was inflicted on the deputy prime minister was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different countries and with the aim of promoting the interests of the terrorists   her office said in the statement  suu kyi on wednesday met indian prime minister narendra modi  who said he shared myanmar s concern about  extremist violence  in rakhine state  modi s government has taken a strong stance on an influx into india of some   rohingya from myanmar over the years  vowing last month to deport them all  the latest violence began when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base  the ensuing clashes and a military counter offensive killed at least  people and triggered the exodus of villagers to bangladesh  suu kyi has been accused by western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution  and some have called for the nobel peace prize she won in  as a champion of democracy to be revoked  myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for a string of attacks on police posts and for burning homes and civilian deaths  it says   non muslims have been displaced  fleeing rohingya and rights monitors say the myanmar army is  conducting a campaign of arson and killings to force them from their homes  two bangladesh government sources said myanmar had been laying landmines across a section of its border for the past three days  possibly to prevent the return of fleeing rohingya  bangladesh will formally lodge a protest on wednesday against the laying of land mines so close to the border  said the sources who had direct knowledge of the situation but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter   a myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the  to prevent trespassing and the military

london  reuters    britain on wednesday outlined several escape routes from the  direct jurisdiction  of the european court of justice after brexit  one of prime minister theresa may s key aims in talks to unstitch  years of eu membership      in a government paper on the highly sensitive topic  britain set out its determination to negotiate a tailor made agreement to enforce its own laws and resolve disputes once it has left the bloc in march       the paper drew attention to several eu agreements which do not require the luxembourg based court s direct jurisdiction over other countries   a clear attempt to encourage more flexibility among eu officials who are protective of the court  may said breaking free of the ecj s jurisdiction meant that britain would be able to make its own laws and british judges and courts would enforce them       we will take back control of our laws   she told reporters  in southern england  in a denial of suggestions by opposition lawmakers that she had watered down her demands by qualifying her words to say  direct  jurisdiction and opening the way to  indirect influence        her words placated many pro brexit lawmakers in her conservative party who say the ecj has slowly sucked power from britain s courts and parliament  leave means leave  a pro brexit campaigning group  said it welcomed the government s  overall commitment  but wanted to make sure  the ecj no longer plays a part in the british legal system         but may s stance could further harden the eu s stance on the court  many european officials see the ecj as the ultimate arbiter of eu law and have said it should continue to guarantee the rights of eu citizens living in britain after brexit and oversee the brexit agreement      in the paper  britain says its court would guarantee the rights of eu citizens or businesses in the country   those rights and obligations will be enforced by the uk courts and ultimately by the uk supreme court   the eu said it was sticking to its stance and hoped to make progress on three areas as a priority    the rights of expatriates  britain s border with eu state ireland and a financial settlement  that distance in viewpoints could delay an agreement with the eu on the divorce  a partner from international law firm bird   bird said    the government s arguments about the role of the ecj will contribute to prolonged uncertainty for businesses in relation to brexit   said richard eccles  the ecj issue has all but halted debate on guaranteeing the rights of expatriates  according to a joint status document  published last month that compared the eu and british positions  but the question of how to resolve disputes after brexit could cause even more difficulties   in its paper  the government suggested it was not asking for the impossible  zeroing in on examples of where the ecj does not have direct jurisdiction in resolving disputes      it said though such cases were  illustrative  to help discussions with the eu      earlier  dominic raab  a pro leave campaigner who is now minister for courts and justice  said britain would most likely suggest britain and the eu should appoint arbitrators and agree a third party to deal with contentious issues post brexit     that s one possible alternative  but i think it s the most likely   he told bbc radio four  adding that britain would have to keep  half an eye  on the case law of the ecj in the future  he  like may  denied that use of the word  direct  before jurisdiction meant the government had now accepted that the court would continue to have influence over british law  but opposition lawmakers said the paper was tantamount to admitting defeat by a government which lost its authority at an ill judged election two months ago by watering down one of its  red lines    not much is left of  brexit minister  david davis s so called  red line  of taking back control from european judges   andrew adonis  a leading pro eu campaigner  said   this is a climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric  even if we leave the single market  european judges will still have considerable power over decisions made in the uk   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

mumbai  reuters    on a sunny morning last week in mumbai after two days of incessant monsoon rain  mohammad altaf had come out of his home for a cigarette when he heard a terrifying crash  followed by a huge swirl of dust  the six storey husainee building where he had lived for the last month had collapsed  trapping nearly  people  thirty four of them were killed  including a newborn baby   it was shocking  i had come down for a smoke  and within two minutes the building was no more   said altaf  who says he was unaware the apartment block was declared unsafe by housing authorities in india s financial hub six years ago  across the teeming city of  million people  thousands of families live in crumbling buildings that have been officially declared uninhabitable   and most of them know it  housing officials say they cannot be forced out because of lax laws  this year  the city s municipal corporation classified  buildings as beyond repair and too dangerous to live in  but close to  of these continue to be occupied  a municipal authority official said  although regulations vary from country to country and also from state to state  authorities in most places have more powers to order evacuations  altaf  in his mid thirties  is a bachelor and was living with two co workers in the apartment in the bhendi bazar locality  one of the oldest in the metropolis  his two flatmates survived  with minor knee and shoulder injuries  after jumping out of their apartment on the third floor  police say they have yet to determine the cause of the collapse  which came after days of intense rain   the  year old apartment block in bhendi bazar  a packed neighborhood of narrow streets  shops and tenements  was declared unsafe in  by the regulator  the maharashtra housing and area development authority  mhada   yet it continued to house altaf and his flatmates  along with five other families  a sweet shop warehouse and even a nursery on the first floor   the owner of the building  hakimmudin bootwala  said seven families moved out by   but other tenants refused despite his urging  one of them had sub let the apartment to altaf and his colleagues   the people were my friends and neighbors first  and tenants later   said the  year old   i sincerely advised them to move out  the building had lots of problems  leakages  the roof was fine  but the walls had become really weak and porous   an official at mhada said there was a law to force residents to evacuate dangerous buildings but enforcing it was impossible because of loopholes and legal challenges  for instance  evicting children and senior citizens could cause trouble  said the housing official  who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the press   we cut water and electricity supply of buildings that are identified as dangerous for living  but people manage to get water and electricity from nearby buildings   said the  official  mhada  which does a routine check of buildings that are older than  years  has identified more than   buildings in the city that need repair  according to its latest list   nine thousand of these  home to nearly   families  need to be redeveloped  the housing official said  adding that the other   were relatively safe due to regular maintenance work done by landowners in consultation with the housing body  once regulators decide a building needs to redeveloped  they have to appoint a developer to renovate or rebuild the structure in the case of public housing  or order private owners to hire one  the developer  in turn  must offer residents alternative accommodation until the work is completed  according to state law in mumbai   but residents often complain the housing they are offered is too small  shabby or too far away   seventy percent of tenants of both privately  and publicly owned buildings must agree to redevelop their building according to state rules  or no redevelopment work can commence  building owners say residents are often unrealistic  refusing to leave even if the alternative housing is adequate  some worry they could lose their tenancy if they move  the mhada official said the agency does everything it can to get residents and developers to clinch an agreement  but that the process often gets mired in legal challenges   the problems of the husainee building were typical  a neighborhood body  the saifee burhani upliftment trust  had been selected by its owner in  to redevelop the building along with other buildings in the neighborhood  even before the husainee had been declared unsafe by mhada  a trust official told reuters it offered alternative housing to the residents in a place around   km    miles  from the building  the official said the trust repeated the offer in  after mhada declared the building unsafe   a reuters team visited the complex where the husainee families who had agreed to move had been relocated  a gated high rise complex with guards and a playground for kids  residents said they were happy with their new apartments  although they complained about the distance to work   but other husainee families refused to move  mhada officials said the trust was in charge of ensuring relocation and redevelopment and mhada could not force the husainee families to leave   the trust has said it has repeatedly tried to evict families from husainee but some residents refused to move       this incident should be a wake up call for the city  and a policy needs to be actioned to evict non cooperating tenants who continue to live in dilapidated buildings   the trust said in a  written reply to reuters queries  building owner bootwala says the residents who refused to leave argued they did not want to upend their lives by moving to a new neighborhood  also  they did not know how long it would take to renovate the building  reuters was unable to talk to other residents from husainee  but neighbors in bhendi bazar told similar stories  despite knowing their buildings were unsafe  many of them did not want to leave   a man in his  in the neighborhood  who refused to give his name  said he was living in a more than  year old building that had been deemed unsafe  the developer offered him temporary housing  km   miles  away  but he said that was too far   i spent my entire life here  i know every lane in this area   the man said   my children s college  my workplace  everything is closer from here   ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News

kuala lumpur  reuters    in a room packed with malaysian civil servants  foreign ministry secretary general ramlan ibrahim raised his right hand as he read out an anti corruption pledge  he was among thousands of state officials nationwide to take such an oath in the past several weeks  part of an anti graft campaign called by prime minister najib razak   the citizens are becoming more informed   they ask for public service which is more efficient  transparent and fair   ramlan said after the event in putrajaya  the administrative capital  the campaign comes as najib prepares to meet president donald trump in the united states this week  where the justice department and the federal bureau of investigation are pursuing investigations into  development berhad     a state fund the prime minister oversaw  najib must also call a general election by mid  although some commentators have suggested he could do so this year itself  the malaysian anti corruption commission  macc  has arrested  dozens of top officials under the anti graft campaign  including officers at national oil company petronas and state controlled palm oil firm felda  more than  arrests were made just this year  macc data showed  the actions are unusual in the southeast asian country  where corruption is seen as widespread  four out of five malaysians aged   cited corruption as the most serious issue facing the country  according to a survey released last month by the global shapers community  a programme under the world economic forum      but critics say the campaign ignores the elephant in the room    the state fund is being investigated in at least six countries for money laundering and misappropriation of funds  including an alleged   million transfer into the prime minister s personal account   malaysia s attorney general closed the  probe in january   and cleared najib of any wrongdoing    the u s  justice department has sought to seize about    billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen  funds  its lawsuits say those involved included najib s step son riza aziz and his close associate jho low   in court filings last tuesday  the fbi  which is conducting a criminal investigation  alleged that potential witnesses in the case fear for their safety and need protection   but investigations into  in malaysia appear to have shut down  macc had  a roomful  of files on   a former macc official told reuters  but the commission could not pursue it once malaysia s attorney general declared the case closed   in a way  this campaign is the macc trying to show that it is doing its job  even if they cannot secure a conviction  against their targets   the macc can show that it has done all it could to stamp out major corruption   said the former official  who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter  cynthia gabriel  director of the kuala lumpur based center to combat corruption and cronyism     said there was  enough substance  for macc to reopen the case on    macc declined to comment on whether the commission would reopen its  investigation    no comment on that  we are very fair in investigating anybody here  whoever they are   deputy chief commissioner azam baki told reporters in putrajaya  anti corruption campaigners say they fear trump s invitation to najib to visit the united states may affect the investigations in the united states   territorial influence and geopolitical interests of the united states appears to have hollowed out its commitment to fight international corruption  much to the detriment of the future of malaysia and the world   gabriel said  u s  based human rights watch  hrw  said trump s invitation was  particularly inappropriate   given najib s use of repressive laws to stifle critics   there s little doubt that najib will use this white house visit to burnish his credentials going into next year s election in malaysia  and redouble his repression of critics using the stamp of approval from this visit   hrw s deputy asia director phil robertson told reuters   najib has said he hopes his visit will drum up more trade and investment for malaysia   i would like to see this as a two way mutually beneficial partnership   he told reporters on friday   i hope the u s  sees malaysia as a reliable partner on issues such as trade and investment  security partnership  counter terrorism and i also hope that u s  companies see us as among the best countries to invest in   a government source said a defense agreement was also on the table  although no details were immediately available  senior leaders of the ruling united malays national organisation  umno  are concerned the party may suffer election losses from the string of graft scandals linked to najib  a source aware of discussions within the party said  with najib and the macc s clean up campaign  the source said  the party hopes to appease malaysians frustrated with the corruption and draw back foreign investors who fled as the probe into  expanded  besides diverting attention from   critics say najib is also using macc s anti graft campaign to target political opponents such as lim guan eng  an opposition leader who is the top elected official in penang province  he has been charged with abuse of power in the purchase of a bungalow   you are going after all sorts of offences  but the biggest one  it

mexico city  reuters    trade negotiators from canada  the united states and mexico presented more proposals for a renewed north american free trade agreement on friday and tried to put behind them threats from u s  president donald trump to pull out of the treaty   teams from the three countries kicked off a second round of talks in mexico city on  areas of closed door discussion  with subjects such as digital commerce and small businesses seen as areas where consensus was possible  officials said  the teams did not debate details  according to officials  but one union leader present said that u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross had indicated he favored north american content of more than  percent in autos built in the nafta region  taking up where they left off in washington talks two weeks ago  the delegations were showing each other proposed language for reworking the accord  without yet seeking to thrash out mutually acceptable compromises  officials present told reuters  trump s multiple attacks on nafta in the build up to the mexico city round were seen by mexican and canadian officials as a ploy to wring concessions  but they have heightened uncertainty over the accord  away from the diplomatic noise  the mexico talks are expected to help define the priorities of each nation rather than yield major advances  nevertheless  trump s warnings have mexico preparing for something hard to imagine even a few months ago   life without the agreement that boosted trilateral trade to around   trillion annually from   billion in   the sept    talks will touch on some thorny topics such as rules governing local content in products made in north america  mexico s economy ministry said in a statement  substantial discussion of such areas is unlikely in either this round or the next one  a source familiar with the process said   we do not expect any major breakthroughs or major developments in this round  we really don t   one official familiar with the negotiating process said  mexican officials believe trump wants to include rules that a certain amount of content must be made in the united states  the head of unifor  canada s largest private sector union  jerry dias  told reporters he had suggested in a recent meeting with u s  commerce secretary ross that the nafta content level for autos be raised to  percent from the current   percent  but ross  he said  had proposed a  more aggressive  level  hundreds of small farmers and union members including speakers from canada gathered outside the mexican congress on friday to demand that nafta be reworked to truly help workers  trump and canadian prime minister justin trudeau spoke by phone on thursday and stressed they wanted to reach a nafta deal by the end of   the white house said  an accord by year end that significantly changes nafta is seen as unlikely  the goal is for an agreement before mexico s  presidential campaign starts in earnest  officials fear the campaign will politicize talks  with nationalist frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador already recommending a tougher line from mexico  nevertheless  one mexican official noted that trump s repeated threats put pressure on his negotiators  forcing them to adopt tougher positions  than they would like   while another official said they were ready to leave the table if needed  trump said this week he might trigger a  day countdown to withdraw from nafta while the talks were ongoing to help meet his goals  which include sharply reducing a   billion annual u s  trade deficit with mexico  nafta  first implemented in   eliminates most tariffs on trade between the united states  canada and mexico   critics say it has drawn jobs from the united states and canada to mexico  where workers are paid far lower wages  supporters say it has created u s  jobs  and that the loss of manufacturing from the united states has more to do with china than mexico  if nafta collapses  costs could rise for hundreds of billions of dollars of trade as tariffs are brought back  free trade lobby groups say consumers would be saddled with higher prices and less availability of products ranging from avocados and berries to heavy trucks     mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo and foreign minister luis videgaray told officials in washington on wednesday that mexico would walk away from the negotiations if trump pulls the trigger on withdrawing from the deal   juan pablo castanon  president of mexico s business coordination council representing the private sector in the talks  said the country was refining a  plan b  that could be up and running within three months of an eventual nafta collapse  talking on mexican television  he said the plan included striking new trade arrangements in asia and latin america  sourcing alternate suppliers such as brazil for grains now imported from the united states  and finding ways to recreate investor guarantees that are included in nafta  graphic on trade

easing immediate pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders who are making electoral capital from lambasting the eu while benefiting from brussels  subsidies  but defiant rejection from some ex communist states that the eu accuses of slipping on democratic standards   hungary called the judgment a political  rape  of eu law   indicated no let up in tensions that are testing the union s internal cooperation  in germany  where chancellor angela merkel is fighting for re election against opponents who criticize her for taking in over a million migrants at the height of the drama  the interior minister threatened legal action against countries which fail to take in their allotted share of syrian and other refugees  but hungary  where outspoken prime minister viktor orban has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his re election campaign for next year  branded the european court of justice ruling  appalling and irresponsible    this decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of europe   foreign minister peter szijjarto said    politics has raped european law and values   italy  now the main destination for migrants taking to the sea following measures to block the route from turkey to greece and from greece northward  has been prominent in calling for the wealthier western states to cut eu subsidies to poor neighbors which do not show  solidarity  in taking in migrants  european commission president jean claude juncker has echoed that threat  warning orban  solidarity is not a one way street   but the eu executive is also anxious to calm tensions ahead of negotiations on a new seven year eu budget that will be all the harder because of a hole left by britain s imminent departure  the commission said on wednesday it may seek fines at the ecj within weeks for hungary  poland and the czech republic if they do not start or resume taking people from the south  poland and hungary  which argue muslim immigration is a threat to their national security and stability  have in two years taken in none of their respective quotas of about   and   people  however  the executive  which is separately considering trying to suspend eastern heavyweight poland for undermining the independence of its judiciary  stressed it wanted solutions that would unite the  nation bloc  slovakia s prime minister said he still rejected quotas but was willing to help in other ways  and as the union digests a brexit vote last year that was partly driven by concern over migration  many states that backed the quota system in  and are increasingly exasperated by polish and hungarian hostility to brussels are also reluctant to force through new policies that may bolster eurosceptics across europe who say the eu is trampling on national sovereignty   if we push it through above their heads  they will use it in their anti eu propaganda at home   one eu diplomat said  while noting that  with the migration crisis dropping out of the headlines  all sides might find a way to resolve the issue  the commission is working on reforms to the so called dublin rules under which people arriving in the eu must stay to claim asylum in the first country they reach  a mechanism to help the likes of greece and italy in emergencies has proved elusive  however  governments may find it easier to negotiate now that the migration is not quite so prominent in local politics  the luxembourg based ecj dismissed  in their entirety  the arguments advanced by hungary and slovakia with backing from poland and endorsed the commission s solution which eventually ordered states to take in nearly   syrians and others   the mechanism actually contributes to enabling greece and italy to deal with the impact of the  migration crisis and is proportionate   the court said in statement  difficulties in identifying candidates for relocation   and a reluctance of refugees to settle other than in the wealthier west of europe   saw fewer than   people relocated in two years  but the commission noted an acceleration in the program this year and said it would continue to move people northward  among the gravest problems the migration crisis caused was member states reimposing controls on internal eu frontiers  that had jeopardized one of the union s most cherished achievements and for a time appeared to threaten to disrupt internal traffic  eu migration commissioner dimitris avramopoulos said special exemptions that have allowed the likes of germany  austria  denmark and sweden to control their borders with eu neighbors should now end when they expire in two months  time  ,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News,Not A Fake News
